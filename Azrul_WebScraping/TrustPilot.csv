"So so. Usually everything is delivered on time, but over last year I had a few orders that did not show up. Plus with the cost of living in the UK and the price of the delivery fee's its probably best to go and pick what you want in the supermarket, particularly when they don't stock everything via Uber.","Date of experience: January 21, 2024",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,DO,Trust Pilot
"I have ordered a McDonald‚Äôs through McDonald‚Äôs app and in one of my milkshakes, there was a large piece of plastic wrapping.

"I ordered a vegan burger using Uber eats and was sent the wrong item. When I contacted Uber eats about this, they responded really well and was very helpful, issuing me a refund and apologising for the mix up.

"They keep sending me emails with a promo, let me pick my food, add it to my cart, apply the promo, then I pay and it says they cant apply the promo I picked even though it shows as available. Then they almost immediately send me another email saying dont lose your promo, so I do it all again, only to have the same thing happen. I think it's a scam so people will take the time and effort to order the food and anticipate it, then at the last minute,  the promo fails, so they'll order it anyway at full price. So disappointing they keep luring me in with the promise of a discount. Which They automatically apply- then say it's no good.

"Service is not consistent. Last time I made sure to include a comment telling the driver to meet me outside because it will be hard to find exactly where my unit is. I included both an English and Spanish version of the instructions in case they had difficulty understanding English, which has happened before. I told them that I would wear a bright pink jacket and would wait for them outside, and everything was completed smoothly. This time, I enter the same instructions and indicated that I would wait for them outside in a bright blue jacket. I see the timer count down to 2 minutes, and the wait time climbs up and down again and again. Eventually, I see a missed call from what seems like the driver and I call them back.

"I have used Uber Eats less than a handful of times, but each time I have had trouble with a promo code being applied. It appears to be applied right up until the point of payment and then  they take the full payment without discount applied. No sign of the discount on the order confirmation. This must be a regular occurrence for them as  one of their support options is'promo not applied '. You'd think they'd be great at resolving such issues due to this, but it is an extremely stressful process. Firstly, they apparently cannot see details of your order until it is delivered so won't do anything until then. Even when you do raise the problem and provide full details they dont read properly and send you back guidance on applying a promo code to a new order, automatically closing your ticket before giving you a chance to respond. Eventually I was given a 'goodwill' gesture of  refund to the amount of the discount that should have been applied but advised I was lucky to get this as it is outside their normal procedure. I genuinely think these discounts are scams to lure people in before they rip you off at the full price then make you jump through hoops to try and claim the discount retrospectively. It's not a coincidence that this has happened to me every time I've applied a promo. I certainly will not risking this and using them again.","Date of experience: January 19, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KA,Trust Pilot
"Uber eats have taken over delivering through the McDonald‚Äôs app. So anything missing or any problems you need to call Uber eats. However be warned if you have any items missing they will refund you however if you order again and have any items missing they will refuse you. Although it‚Äôs actually the McDonald‚Äôs that‚Äôs made the mistake you have to talk to Uber Eats. They inform you the couriers name and transport they will be using well the motorbike the courier arrived had no motor as it was a bicycle and the bag had hardly any insulation.So the food that should arrive complete, at least edible temperature ended up being missing items and had to heat the food ourselves.So we learnt our lesson the hard way!

I must have had my notifications turned off on the app.. which I didn‚Äôt - how did I know to contact the driver at 14:32 when it was to be estimated for 14:25 (but still not with me) driver waited 7 minutes after declaring they were unable to find address to then message me on the app (their policy - may I add says they wait 7 minutes and contact you at time of arrival to destination, before marking as delivered even if it isn‚Äôt) the policy is not to message a customer 7 minutes after waiting and not contacting them to say they can‚Äôt find address and that the road says ‚Äúroad closed‚Äù when he was nowhere near the input address. Marks it as delivered anyway..2. The other blame was to say to check my address is correct before submitting order - which I did- my address was correct. I proved this by sending a screenshot of both the chat and location of where I was, and where drive was when marking it completed. Showed the address I put in and the one where he delivered to..After requesting a refund, I was told I‚Äôm not eligible with those excuses, so I asked for a manager and then when this happens.. the operator ‚ÄúAli‚Äù blocked me from using Uber eats completely.no longer able to contact the help desk or use the app to order food. I did nothing wrong, showed evidence it was the driver who went to the wrong address, that wasn‚Äôt given and then how he was rude about not being able to it, to then get treated with the upmost disrespectful ‚Äúhelp desk operator‚Äù. I paid ¬£16 for a single Mc Donald‚Äôs select meal including delivery and service.. and to then not get one of the most expensive meals I‚Äôve ever got from Mc Donald‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a joke! I am disgusted and would not recommend using this company for any food orders.

"Uber Eats was running an offer through Poke Company for a BOGO deal, buy one get one bowl free. I ordered two, the discount showed up for me in my cart, I placed the order, it charged me full price. I called customer service and spoke to numerous people, none of whom were helpful and they refused to refund or let me even speak to a supervisor. Their terms of offers and promos are very confusing--if you plan to use either of these options, read the fine print. Even then, it could apparently still show up in your cart with the offer and then you'll be fully charged anyway. Never again.

"Uber eats Ok.  I am actually tired of all the wrong orderes being recieved.  As the issue should be with the individual merchant this complaint against Uber Eats is because they penalize customers when merchants gets something wrong.  To elaborate, recently, Jan 6, 2024 order placed and one item was not received, but rather a completely different item.  A picture was taken and sent to UE.  1- not only did they NOT respond within the 48 hrs but instead, 13 days later!, they said the food was picked up and no refund will be given. First, 13 days later is unacceptable.  Second, the order was NEVER picked up it was delivered.  Third, how dare you penalize the customer and let the merchant just get away with getting the order wrong.  This is wrong and flat out an unacceptable business model.  I assure you if you punish the merchant when appropriate like getting orders wrong, then I‚Äôm sure they will start reading the orders correctly.  Keep my money that you stole from me and other customers, Mr Merchant and Uber Eats.  I‚Äôm not in need of that, you are.  I am happy to continue to post everywhere I can about your flawed business and lack of respect for customers.  Go ahead and stand by your merchants when they continuously get orders wrong and ignore your customers.  Without customers there would be no need for merchants and Uber Eats.

"I make many orders from UberEATS, but in the past few months, when I am missing an item in my order, they are not getting back to me, or it takes weeks to hear something back from their customer service support team in the app. Postmates was the app I used to use. They bought the company. An order was made on January 6, 2024, and they returned to me on January 19, 2024, at 7:00 AM. I ordered with Subway, and one of my items was not delivered. After I didn‚Äôt hear back from UberEATS in two hours, I contacted the store, and they said they ran out of oatmeal cookies and I needed to contact UberEATS for a refund. The store should‚Äôve got me and given me another option or cancel the order, but they didn‚Äôt. I contacted UberEATS, and now, 12 days later, they refuse to give me a refund because they said after the investigation, they can‚Äôt confirm I didn‚Äôt receive my order of oatmeal cookies.  Please know I spend around $300.00 a week with UberEATS. I had a drink missing from another order, and they refused to refund me.  UberEATS has to understand when you have a customer who orders a lot, and they likely will have more requests for refunds or complaints about missing items. UberEATS owes me about $159.00 in five months on missing items; they refund to give me credit or refund back to my credit cards‚ÄîUberEATS is not customer friendly.","Date of experience: January 06, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tyrone Hill,Trust Pilot

And anyway, sitting around does nothing for the quality of the food which is unfair on the restaurant who spent time preparing it.What‚Äôs more irritating is that Uber won‚Äôt do anything about it so you end up with a delivery of freezing cold fast food when it‚Äôs minus 3 in January that even the dog won‚Äôt touch.

I struggled with the app as it required me to apply a verification before the order could be sent out. The driver sent message no hot chocolate . I advised milk. the order arrived late and cold as well as missing the entire kids wonka pancakes meal. I was notified I was to get a credit for being late. I then sent in I was missing the meal. After I wrote a bad review my bill was then updates to a higher amount. Not only did they take the entire 50 gift card balance. Ubereats charged my debit card 14 something as well as the tip . for grand total of 71 and some change.

After I sent the delivery man as he wanted to delivery it to right place, I contacted the customer service again by chat. Explained the situation, but it kept saying WAIT until they investigate. I waited and as the delivery man changed the delivery status to 'complete' as he deliver it to the papoyes customer, the chat staff said he can't do anything. What a joke.

I will keep reporting about this, urging everyone everywhere not to use Uber Eats as they may simply lose their money and get nothing in return, and attempt to claim back the money from Uber Eats through my bank instead.

"AWFUL service and customer service. Missing item reported with cost of nearly ¬£8, it was the main item. Called them to complain and was offered a refund to the amount of ¬£2. When I queried this, I was told that as I'd ordered the item as part of a meal deal cost ¬£10, they could only refund ¬£2 as 1 out of 3 items were missing. When I queried this again I was told it was their's, and the restaurants policy to do this. When I again queried why it was ¬£2 and not the ¬£8 minus the discount (¬£2.51 so refund of ¬£5.49), she said they divide it by 3 as its a 3 item meal. This again made no sense as ¬£10√∑3 does not equal ¬£2! I asked for an email or number to call to complain further up and was told there wasn't one. Rude and illogical service.

Complained to restaurant, they can't do nothing, contact uber. Going round in circles and still no resolution.

If I didn‚Äôt want it I would order it. So being like oh sorry here‚Äôs 2 quid back is completely useless because the whole convenience of ordering is he sole reason.

"UberEats itself is a wonderful concept and great app, but their customer service is seriously lacking. I have placed several orders where several items have been missing, and when I call Uber Eats to report the missing food, the only response I have gotten was that I would be refunded for the items. That's great and all, but what do I do with the people who have nothing to eat because they didn't receive their order??? Why is it not in the policy to contact the restaurant and ask them to deliver the missing food items??? Last night my family and I ordered over $100 worth of food for dinner. After an hour, my son was literally crying because he was hungry. The time for delivery kept extending later and later. I received a phone call from the restaurant itself. Apparently the driver picked up the wrong food. He said he would be contacting Uber and they would contact me. Another 10-15 minutes went by before I finally heard from Uber. The woman who called me from Uber spoke barely any English and was extremely difficult to understand. She informed me that my order had been canceled, I would be refunded, and if I wanted, I could go back to the app and place another order. I was confused by this. S instead of just figuring out the mix-up with the driver and getting me the correct food, I had to place another order and wait ANOTHER hour?!?!?! As I was asking the woman to clarify why that needed to be done, she literally began to talk over me, as if I was not even speaking. Then she tried to dismiss me and end the call and I asked her to wait because I still had questions. She again ignored me and spoke over me and then hung up on me! Let me make this clear: SHE HUNG UP ON A CUSTOMER WHO WAS ASKING FOR HELP IN CLARIFYING THE SITUATION!!! As someone who has worked in customer service for over 15 years, I found this absolutely unacceptable. When a situation like this mix-up happens, which I was completely understanding of and not at all irate, a customer service representative should have been kind and apologetic, offering solutions and listening to any questions I might have, NOT talk over me, ignore me, and then hang up on me.To make matters worse, I called Uber Customer Service to complain about this rude representative, and the woman I spoke to at that time was very kind and helpful, and she apologized for the other representative, and told me that a supervisor would be calling me later on in the evening. I asked her if they would be calling me that same night and she said yes. Well, here it is, the next day, and my phone has yet to ring. So Uber Eats itself is great.

"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received from Uber Eats, specifically regarding an order I placed with Soi Thai in Clapham. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of appalling.After purchasing a meal through Uber Eats from Soi Thai, I suffered from a severe case of food poisoning. Distressed by this, I promptly contacted Uber Eats seeking assistance and resolution to this health hazard. To my dismay, the response I received was both unhelpful and dismissive.The lack of concern and assistance displayed by Uber Eats in handling such a critical issue is utterly unacceptable. As a customer, I expected a responsible and prompt resolution to ensure the safety of all patrons. The refusal to address my concerns is indicative of a poor commitment to customer welfare and highlights the inadequacy of Uber Eats in managing food quality issues.Considering the severity of the matter, I feel compelled to report this incident to the relevant health and safety authorities. It is disheartening that such a trusted platform as Uber Eats fails to take responsibility for the potential health risks posed by its affiliated restaurants.I strongly urge Uber Eats to reevaluate its customer service protocols and prioritize the health and safety of its patrons. Neglecting such issues not only tarnishes the reputation of your service but also poses serious risks to the well-being of your customers.This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied and concerned about the standards upheld by Uber Eats.

"I had placed an order from UberEats and gave instructions for the delivery driver to come to the front of my building as many will, for whatever reason, go to the back.  My driver sent me a text saying he was here and I told him I was at the front, even mentioning that there were instructions for him to go there.  Instead of driving to the front of the building, he walked my food - in the middle of cold (-8 C) weather - to the front.  Because my building is large, my order was cold and inedible.  I contacted customer service via the app 4 times and all 4 times was disconnected without resolution.  I had requested a refund or a credit in the amount of my order, but they refused; stating it was against their policy to do so.  The last agent I was chatting with at least offered to have a supervisor call me back.The supervisor, Angel, did call me at 1 in the morning.  He kept cutting me off when I tried to explain the issue and then proceeded to get upset because I raised my voice.  I told him I had been in customer service for years and have offered full credit whenever an issue arose, which was rare.

Once again it wasn‚Äôt a special request at the end the no cheese was literally one of the options available so surely they should be able to accommodate that‚Ä¶I basically told them if they aren‚Äôt willing to refund the burger I‚Äôll be raising a dispute with my bank for the entire order so their choice and wasn‚Äôt given any response.Even called the restaurant and credit to the manager there he was very apologetic but said he probably has even less chance of speaking to someone useful at Uber than I do and the way Ubers system works if a option doesn‚Äôt have a price attached it doesn‚Äôt come through to the restaurant and they get a lot of complaints from Uber orders for this same situation.Credit to them I did get an email through the night it has been sent to an escalation team and they issued a full refund but it shouldn‚Äôt have got to that point and it would‚Äôve been nice to have been told that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen rather than just being ignored until then and I feel had I not threatened to start a dispute it wouldn‚Äôt have happened.Shame that companies outsource to save money because they just don‚Äôt care about customer experience‚Ä¶,"Date of experience: January 06, 2024",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,BL,Trust Pilot

"UberEats sent me someone else‚Äôs food order and then refused to refund my order because it goes against their ‚Äòstandard‚Äô, even though I presented them with proof. I am a vegetarian and they brought food containing meat that I could have become very ill from consuming. Their customer service is AI generated and just sends the same templated answers over and over again. They stole nearly $100 from me. From doing some research it sounds like this regularly happens to their customers. I will NEVER use this service again!Edit: After reaching out to their customer service for days and days (being hung up on and treated like trash) I did eventually get a refund, but I had to call them 3x and reach out 15+ times over the app. I will still never use their service again.","Date of experience: January 01, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Marie Belisle,Trust Pilot

"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent experience I had with your service. On 04/01/24 at approximately 5:30pm , I placed an order through the Uber Eats app for delivery to my address.To my dismay, the food never arrived, despite the estimated delivery time having passed. I waited patiently, but there was no sign of the delivery driver. Strangely, the app indicated that my order had been successfully delivered, which is far from the truth. This has left me both frustrated and inconvenienced.What adds to my dismay is that I was charged for the undelivered order. I find it utterly unacceptable to be charged for a service that was not rendered as expected. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution. I request a refund for the full amount charged for my order.I understand that unforeseen circumstances may occur, but communication is key. A simple notification or explanation for the delay or non-delivery would have been appreciated.I urge you to take swift action in rectifying this issue to restore my trust in Uber Eats. Please respond promptly with the steps you will be taking to address this matter and process the refund.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a timely resolution.","Date of experience: January 04, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,gapz A-town,Trust Pilot

Shortly after the restaurant called us to say they had received an identical order from Uber and they called us as it was clearly a duplicate - they cancelled this order.  Uber then sent me an email saying that the order had been cancelled however the restaurant had started preparing the food  - so they were charging me the full amount plus delivery.  I had not paid for the cancelled order - but they decided to use the card details held for my uber taxi account to take the money.

"I would not recommend Uber Eat. I live in Manchester and the service here is poor. It was very often I missed some items from my order. Anyway my money was refunded. But not last time. My order was delivered to the wrong address, I could see it on photo, provided by driver. He left the order outside the door. I have never selected the option to leave my order outside. I was always waiting. The driver tried to contact me, I sent him a message to remind my address. The Uber Eat customer team decided that I was eligible for a refund. I sent them the picture, made by a driver. But they somehow refunded me a half an order. I sent them emails and every time different agent respond and every time differently. It is not possible to contact Uber team and you'll hardly find a complaint section. I only could get a webchat. My issue still not resolved.I will never order again by Uber Eat. If you have an option to order strait from restaurants or supermarkets do it, it is cheaper and less stressful. Anyway, if you decided to order from Uber Eats, I recommend: make screenshots of the cost (how it looks first time) and items on your order, the time your order takes, try to contact a driver by message and take screenshots. If a driver making a picture - you need to save it. All of that it you will need to provide as an evidence for customer team. Or your money will never be refunded.

I went to Ubereats to get my refund for purchases never received. I was at ease at first once I got it back. Shortly after, I got an notification about a pending $77.69 that I didn't spend at all it was actually $55.69  . But obviously due to items not being available it went down. When i got the notification about the $77.69 came through $24.84 came out of my account. Now if anyone knows math I had $15.00 left after $24.84 came out. Add it together it was deducted from the refund. The first person I spoke to put me on hold for 10 minutes, and someone else picked up the call. Everything went left when she tried to discredit the receipts I was able to prove. She wanted to argue and say I was wrong. I called back a little later and someone actually did try to help get this resolved. Keep in mind all my information is private and no one else outside of me had it.

"I have an Uber account where I use my business email, but I always receive promotions to my secondary and personal account. So I tried to use one of these promotional codes and it didn‚Äôt work. I called customer service, waited on hold for over 10mins, then talked to customer service. They said that because this code was sent to a different email address I could not take advantage of it under my original account and that I would have to make a NEW account in order to use the promotional code. Ridiculous. Hungrily I set up a new account with that email address, and once I tried to use the code, it wasn‚Äôt valid. Sadly, I feel that Uber eats only sends promotional emails as exactly that, promotion. They have no intention of following through on their offers, they only want to drive business towards their app.  This experience was quite possibly the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with customer service.","Date of experience: January 01, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DD,Trust Pilot

"The initial experience was satisfactory, but there has been a gradual decline. If everything goes smoothly and there are no issues with your order, then all is well. However, when you need to contact customer support due to an order problem, the situation becomes problematic.On numerous occasions, orders have arrived cold, likely due to drivers being overwhelmed with other deliveries. Items are frequently missed or incorrect. In cases where a main dish is missing from an order, a refund is not provided for the entire service; only the missing item is refunded. This means having to pay for their service twice if you wish to order a replacement meal for a family member who missed out.Additionally, getting assistance over the phone or through chat proves to be challenging.

"I tried to order with Uber Eats on Dec 27th, 2023 for the first time and wanted to use the Coupon that I received for $30 off for the first order with FIRSTEATS30 that expired on Dec 31st 2023.When going to the checkout, Uber Eats automatically applied an offer for ‚Äúno delivery fee‚Äù instead of the coupon for $30 off. We tried several times to apply the $30 off coupon code and each time, Uber Eats applied the free delivery offer instead. This is called bait and switch and is illegal. There was no way to opt out of the no delivery fee offer.  I wanted to document that and tried taking a screenshot. By accident I placed the order for the full price, with no $30 discount. I called the restaurant immediately to stop preparing the dishes. It took me about 3 min to figure out how to cancel the order on the app. Then I started a help chat with 3 different agents Roshinikumar, Manuel and Aamir. All 3 said they are not able to refund and are holding back $51.71 from a $63 order because they claimed that the restaurant has already started to prepare the food.  I informed them that this was not the case. Later, I spoke with another agent on the phone who called up the restaurant and refunded me the ‚Äústolen‚Äù money. This multi million or maybe even billion business had absolutely crappy customer service and did not stand up to their offer to give $30 off for the first order.I will NEVER EVER recommend this business and NEVER order from them.

"I wish I can give zero stars.Let me start by saying after ordering nearly 500 orders via Uber eats and more than 1000 rides with Uber, I have now deleted my account with them.Today I ordered food for my kids from Greggs. I put the order in at 2.20pm and about 10 min after they say the delivery guy is picking up my order. When it was about 2.45pm I wanted to cancel the order because I can see in the app that the delivery guy has been at the same spot for the last 15min and of course now by the time food now gets to me it cold and not fresh. The ETA time keeps on moving longer and longer. Bare in mind I have a child with learning difficulties who is waiting for his food.By now I got another ETA update which now said that the ETA is at 3.15pm which by now was nearly an hour since I initially made the order. When I initially made the order it said on the app that the estimate delivery was 25min. I now went into the chat app of Uber eats explaining to them the situation and asked for my delivery to be cancelled because it‚Äôs taking too long. The Uber eats app is not good at all. You send one message and then they will send you 5 to 6 messages at the same time which does not give you a chance to read all. I saw the message do you want to cancel and I said yes stating my reason and letting them know that the driver has been at the same spot which is not even at the restaurant for more than 20min. I then went through the thread and saw due to me cancelling they are charging me about ¬£19. The food that I ordered was ¬£20. These people whoever dealt with my case has no shame. After they took my money without any investigation regarding the ETA closed the chat which did not allow me to chat any further.I then called customer service which was no help at all. I then sent them an email aExplaining that the ETA kept changing and driver was at the same spot for more than 20min and that I only saw that they will charge me after I went through the chat thread but they responded saying that I wanted to cancel and so they did and at the end of the response they said ‚Äúno response needed‚Äù. How horrible and disgusting is this customer service. They did not even bother to investigate why the delivery driver accepted the job but stayed on the same spot for more than 20min. These horrible people did not even consider that that money they took was to buy a meal for my son with learning disability.No investigation was made regarding the driver.Many times I‚Äôve ordered and I can see the driver took the job but the driver would take their own time to deliver. Many times my order is wrong, many times I receive an order where the food is spilled but I don‚Äôt really complain but today this company has made a fool out of me and took money from me, money that was meant to buy my son a meal from his favourite restaurant. I am extremely disappointed by this company, their customer service and their  delivery service.We are paying a fee, we are paying the drivers so why are drivers allowed to pick up your order when they feel like doing so. Why were their no investigation into the delivery guy‚Äôs ETA or why was he at the same spot for more than 20min. Uber Eats needs to know that their service is not free. We pay for the food and delivery service so why are we treated as if they are doing us a favour and as if the service is free.As said I am so disappointed and disgusted with this company.","Date of experience: December 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,VT,Trust Pilot

"First and last time using uber eats. I placed the order online to buy the family some kfc as no-one was up to cooking. The order was placed at 9.10pm with an eatimated delivery of 10-15mins, with an note stating delivery at 10.15pm at the latest. The estimated delivery time changed repeatedly until it was 10.15pm and still showing as processing. Then the delivery time jumped to 10.35pm with the explanation that they couldn't find someone to deliver - so for the full hour they had no-one assigned to our order but just kept us waiting. For an exhausting amount of time we tried using the help section to cancel the order or speak with someone, but got nowhere. Ubereats does have a designated phone line but you will not find a number for it anywhere online (dec23). Eventually, we phoned the Uber taxi service, which Uber makes a point of telling you is geared for travelling customers. Funnily enough, it recognised the mobile number we used for the order and the answering service said it was transferring us to ""uber eats"". I do believe there is a degree of ""spin"" at work here, as we were then told the wait times were extensive and advised to call back later, seconds before putting us through to a rep, where we were able to cancel the order although we have to wait up to 5 working days for it to reach my bank.

"We ordered food for our autistic son on the mcdonald's app. After the delivery time being continuously pushed back with the order status ""picking the order up"" for about 10-15 minutes and the driver on site for this entire duration, our sons food was finally showing out for delivery. This was then followed by the delivery time being pushed further out due to the driver going to a different address. I am under the assumption the driver had multiple deliveries to make, our food arrived. The food was stone cold. I phoned customer service which was of no use at all. I tried to escalate this and although I was put through to a ""manager"", he was a waste of time and breath speaking to. He kept quoting they couldn't do anything as it was delivered within a reasonable time and he was following his guidelines. When I asked what the guidelines were, he went on to quote the delivery time. When I told him again it was delivered after this time and the tracking was apologising for the order being late he still insisted that this was reasonable. We have used uber eats directly and through mcdonald's quite often due to our son and on the previous occasions when we have felt the need to call they have good.

"Uber Eats has illegally stolen hundreds of dollars from me. On my most recent order to 7-Eleven (7451 S Gartrell Rd) which I paid $43.08 for and selected the option ""meet at door"" and to give a code to receive my order, it was cancelled... before the person ever arrived or was even near my house. It said it was contacted by the uber eats support team, I contacted them, they told me that because the order was started I cannot receive a refund? So because the order was started, and never arrived, after waiting over an hour, i cannot receive a refund when they never gave me what I paid for.This is a common theme for uber eats. Within the last years of order from uber eats they have multiple times, with proof of food not being delivered or receiving the wrong food denied me a refund. The conduct of uber eats and the guidelines they have their employees follow is ILLEGAL. They are told to NOT refund or even respond to customers after they complain.On my previous Better Business Bureau  complaints #20673331, #20437713 & #20454894 each time they claimed they contacted me via email or in-app and each time, did not. Uber Eats tries to deceive the Better Business Bureau and those reading complaints by claiming they reached out and resolved the problem when they never did, they just hope that the person stops responding to the complaint follow ups.If I am not refunded the money from this order and last 2 complaints I did not receive a refund for I am going to be taking legal action. This time, they admitted the food did not come and will not be refunding me, last time the drop off location was wrong, which they admitted, the time before that the submitted picture from the driver showed no food being dropped off, I was denied a refund each time.

"I want to share my recent experience with Uber Eats, and unfortunately, it has been quite disappointing. Firstly, there's a concerning practice where they charge an additional ¬£10 months after ordering, labeling it as a tip without prior notification. This could easily go unnoticed if you don't regularly check your bank statements.Moreover, I encountered a delivery issue where items were missing from my order, and despite contacting them, they refused to refund me without providing any explanation. I have preserved all communication records and screenshots highlighting their stance on not refunding even when the delivery was incomplete.To resolve the issue, I contacted my bank, and they refunded the amount, expressing displeasure at the situation. It's disheartening to see such practices from a service that many rely on.I advise everyone to exercise caution when using the Uber Eats app. Informing my family and friends led to them deleting the app due to similar concerns.

"Just deleted both uber and uber eats apps,ordered food yesterday merchant was taking long,so I cancelled because estimated waiting time kept going up,and they had to change drivers,because of how long the restaurant was taking,instead of refunding my money because its was taking long they kept my money and refuse to give it back,they are nothing but a bunch of opportunistic thieves and will NOT be using them again,customers be careful because this is what's happening, you can't cancel if the merchants are taking long,because according to customer service, they already accepted the order,so basically we have no rights.","Date of experience: December 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,ME,Trust Pilot
"First of all, their customer service is almost non-existent, it took me a lot of time to find a way to flag my issue.The problem was that I ordered food by mistake. The restaurant accepted the order immediately and I cancelled it right after. The whole thing took like 3 seconds, but UberEATS is not refunding me the money. According to them, once the restaurant accepts the order it means they are already preparing it, which in this case was physically impossible. It's like paying in a shop with a wrong bill and the cashier, that didn't even put it in the box yet, stands there with your bill in his/her hand refuses to give it back to you, saying he/she already bought supplies with it. Wouldn't you feel like you've been robbed?Additionally, this app used to have no additional fees. Then they started to charge a service fee, later a delivery fee and lastly the prices of most products are more expensive than they are in the restaurant's menu. You end up paying like extra 5-10‚Ç¨ for your order, and they have the nerve to offer you a ""premium"" membership to remove some of these additional fees, as if they are doing you a favor. They are greedy and unethical, and we are a lot of people feeling this way.","Date of experience: December 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,√ÅB,Trust Pilot

"UberEats is an absolute nightmare, and I'm beyond frustrated with their terrible service. I've been waiting for a refund for an undelivered order for nearly a month, and their responses are nothing but a bunch of excuses. When I complained, they had the audacity to tell me, ""It looks like you have already been refunded for this order."" Really? Because my bank account begs to differ!According to their so-called ""customer support,"" the refund should take 5-10 business days to reflect on my account. Well, guess what? It's been over 15 working days, and I'm still empty-handed. They conveniently blamed a mysterious ""pending"" amount on my bank statement, claiming it would disappear within 5-10 business days. Surprise, surprise ‚Äì it did vanish, but my refund is nowhere to be found.As if that's not enough, UberEats also managed to overcharge me for a repeated order and, to add insult to injury, charged me double for the tip. Are they serious? This is nothing short of a scam! It's clear that UberEats is more interested in taking your money than delivering a reliable service. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for your food delivery needs.

"UBER EATS DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. I would give MINUS STARS if I could !!!!!  Yesterday I ordered a Mc Delivery from my local branch . Not for the first time items were missing. Obviously I rang Uber eats support line and told them the items that were missing. After being on hold I was told that for some reason ( I can only assume that because I have called on several occasions before about missing items ) that my refund was refused. I asked to speak to a manager and got the same response.  Uber eats was NOT prepared to reimburse me for a fault that was NOT my own !!! So the money for the missing items is basically THEFT .   given how poor the service is that I've received I would imagine that the attitude travels all the way up to the top. Trying to get some sort of resolution from UBER EATS is so difficult. Web sites make it as difficult as possible to complain. Trying to talk to anyone who gives a crap is impossible. AVOID UBER EATS at all COSTS .

"Have used Uber eats for years, occasionally experienced slight issues but nothing on the level I received 2 days ago. So I ordered x2 meals from Rio‚Äôs , and a bag of mixed chicken. On opening the FIRST BOX MEAL, I noticed a piece of plastic sticking from underneath the burger, after inspection it turned out to be hard sharp plastic. I immediately boxed the meal back up, bagged ALL the food back up and contacted Uber eats to redirect the driver back to my property to collect this food. I notified Uber about the issue and also attached images. NONE of the food was eaten , touched, or tampered with I kindly re wrapped this up and asked for a full refund and for the restaurant to collect. I was refused a refund under their policy and procedures even though I asked them to collect this food. I‚Äôm absolutely appalled. You would never go out to eat, find contaminated food, with sharp objects and pay for that meal you would send it back to the kitchen. Uber have now taken my money, and are refusing to get back to me. And I‚Äôm here 3 days later with the food still bagged up, going mouldy, ready to be collected. I expect a full refund. This is disgusting. How dare you think I am entitled to pay for something I would not dare consume or give to anyone else to consume. Contaminated, disgusting food with sharp objects. I am appalled at the lack of service; every form of contact I get a different operated who have no clue what they are talking about. One of them even advised my claim for a missing item was rejected.

"Glitchy app not updated properly - refused refund for propblem with app. Difficult to get help with order issues, app purposefully designed to take you around in circles - hard to find or even ring customers services - I had to actually find a way to sneakily get through to their Uber Rider support to get a transfer to Customer Services (you can only ring when you have a live order).Full explanation of issue belowI made an order on my route home - the app was trying to deliver to my live location. I updated the app to drop off to my home address and placed the order. Unfortunately the app was still trying to deliver to the street I was on - the app does not let you update the order and theres no apparent way of updating order any other way. I had no choice but to cancel my food. I reordered and the app recognised second time that I'd updated to my home address. I want a refund for the first cancelled order - it was not my fault the app was not updating properly, and I also reordered immediately after so the food would not have been wasted as I reordered it - the specific takeaway also took ages with my order so was running behind so no food would have even been prepped on the first cancelled order.

I received everything EXCEPT one item worth 3.95$.  I looked into the help section and the option ""missing item"" was not there.  So I contacted help who refused to refund the missing item.  I was not asking much.  I was asking 3.95$/44.68$ they refused.  I took the conversion in screenshot, called PayPal, sent it to them and they agreed that this was not okay and refunded the 3.95$.  On December 14 due to having automatic payments UberEats charged me that 3.95$ again.  I contacted them, they said they would transfer me to a specialist and it would take 6 to 12h. On the 18th I wrote back saying with the lack of answer I am filing with PayPal again.  Today I cancelled my UberOne membership considering after this event they removed all my promotion.

"Having created a delivery order with one supermarket on the UBER app, I had not noticed that there was still ONE small item (milk) left in the cart from a second supermarket. Proceeding to check out, I authorised payment for the main delivery, however the UBER app somehow placed a second order for the small item not required.  No where during the process did the app inform me of this, nor did I authorise the additional order / payment.  The main delivery arrived, followed shortly by the incorrect order.  For context, the incorrect order item value was ¬£1.50 - however after fee's and delivery charge it came to ¬£11!!! Which, even if it had been a valid order, would amount to theft!! I quickly contacted UBER via the chat function, and explained the situation.  Suffice it say, UBER was not in the slightest interested in resolving the issue, and repeatedly explained that the order had been generated from a device associated to my account.  They basically dismissed my concern out of hand, and were not willing to accept that the issue was caused by the app.  I am completely disgusted with the attitude of UBER in this case, and warn all users to be vigilant when committing their hard earned money to this company.

"Don‚Äôt order here. All their delivery times are way too ambitious. In general they are 2x as slow as they promise. There are many other alternatives. Just eat has shown consistently to be much more accurate in terms of timing. Additionally, uber eats also adds probably 20-25% on every item compared to the price they sell in the restaurant. Best is to avoid them by using just eat or any other delivery service.","Date of experience: December 20, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,N,Trust Pilot

"I am extremely disappointed with my Uber Eats experience with KFC. The delivery was a disaster from start to finish. Despite placing my order promptly, it took over an hour for the driver to even pick it up. By the time the delivery arrived, a whopping 90 minutes later, everything was cold ‚Äì a clear indication that the food had been neglected. To add insult to injury, the items weren't even properly sorted, resulting in a mixed-up mess.What's more infuriating is the lack of support from Uber Eats. Despite reporting the issue, they only refunded me for the mixed-up items, completely ignoring the fact that the entire order was cold and inedible. This is unacceptable, and it reflects poorly on both KFC and Uber Eats. I won't be using this service again, and I strongly advise others to think twice before trusting them with their meal deliveries.","Date of experience: December 19, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,–ï–≤–≥–µ—à–∞ –í–æ—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥–∞,Trust Pilot

"Most disgusting company I've ever had to deal with. I am part of Uber one, on two occasions now you've credited my account due to mistakes made by yourself (as your promise to your Uber one customers). The first ¬£5 was credited because items were out of stock and my order was cancelled and the second time was due to the order taking too long so I had ¬£10 in my Uber cash pot. I placed an order and used ¬£5 of this cash towards the order but upon looking at the invoice the ¬£5 wasn't actually credited to the order it was just stolen from my cash pot. I messaged you about it and you relied you have 'decided not to give me the ¬£5 anymore'!!!!!! I've then been to check my account today and it appears the other ¬£5 has now been taken as well. You make promises to your customers when part or Uber one but then decide afterwards you don't want to give them the credit promised? If you didn't want to give it dont make the promise and don't give it. But the fact you've put it into my account and then stolen it back is absolutely disgusting. This will be going to consumer rights and I'll be contacting citizens advice of where I stand with this as in my eyes it's theft of my money you had already given me then decided to take back for no apparent reason or explanation from yourselves.

It took Uber eats 1 hour and 10 minutes to deliver the food, when I contacted them they refused to refund the order, even when escalating this to a manger they still refused to refund stating that because they delivered it within the time frame of the 3rd driver accepting this 40 minutes later after 2 previous drivers accepted them cancelled they are not responsible for issues with the order being stone cold or items missing.

"If I could give them a 0 star I would, absolutely shocking customer service from the driver that was tasked to deliver my McDonalds food last night; it's not the first time I have had issues with this company delivery service, but last night takes the mickey. I clearly listed my address and postcode (a residential address, might I add) correctly on my order, (no one else except uber has difficulties with my address), yet the driver's app that he uses sent him to the wrong location. When he called to ask why I was not at the destination to accept my order, I informed him that there was no-one at my house and I asked him where he was. He rudely stated that he was at the steel works entrance (3 and a half miles away from where I live in the middle of an industrial estate). When I explained he was in the wrong area and tried to give him directions he flat out and rudely stated he would not be delivering my order as it is too far out of his way. I had to argue that I had clearly stated my correct address when placing the order and that he should complete the delivery to the correct address as required but he just told me he would not deliver as he would not get paid the extra mileage - how is this my issue? He went to the wrong address, he is at fault, yet he was trying to blame me - He simply told me that he would not deliver and that the order will be cancelled and I should take it up with McDonalds then hung up the phone. So i was left out of pocket (as Uber will take up to 15days to refund me - your customer service line is just as useless when I tried calling them alongside McDonalds by the way), with 2 very hungry children. I will be avoiding the company at all cost in the future -as will everyone I have spoken to who have had similar issues - clearly this company does not care about its customers.","Date of experience: December 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Kayleigh John,Trust Pilot

The customer service is an absolute joke and simply asked why I wanted to cancel despite me already explaining before transferring (which apparently will now take 6-14 hours to address, it is very possible I will be billed again by the time this happens).

I did what i was asked and now Uber is refusing to give me a refund of 12¬£ that i was charged. I can see a lot of people suffering from this , I saw that we can sue through small claims court , also i hope that everyone who has this problem does that.

"Refusal of refund after no delivery was madeUpdate: Uber Eats promised a refund. As soon as I'll have confirmation of it, I'll update again. As a sign for good will, the review is currently at 3 stars instead of the 1 star from before.Original review:I had ordered a Subway sandwich as I am heavily pregnant, was in a bit of pain and thus not feeling ok to cook. For some reason the website had changed my address so that the delivery driver was at the wrong house. We had a phone conversation for about 11 minutes where I also gave him the new address. He was adamant I come to the site to look for him even though I repeatedly told him I'm not ok for going outside as I was advised not to do so when not feeling ok. He then left my order on the street under the rain where he was. I ended up without dinner.When I contacted customer support, they now said that I'm not eligible for a refund. I find this not ok at all and it will be the last time I ordered (it was the second time in total). If the website had properly shown that the geo location was wrong, I would've corrected it but it didn't show up. If the delivery driver had bothered to type the new address in, everything would've been fine. If I had been physically able meet him at the site, I would have done so. But no. They rather want to keep my money for a service nor done than be kind to an expectant mother in physical pain a few days before the due date.I am disappointed.","Date of experience: December 12, 2023",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,LI,Trust Pilot

"Well fortunately I actually got the 100 dollar Uber eats card via Caesers Rewards Sportsbook and Casino for the tier level I achieved and that's what will make this review civil as it will be, had I subsequently purchased the card with my hard earned money I would be absolutely beside myself and I would be attacking the company with every single breath in my body for a number of ridiculous reasons but I didn't pay for it with my cash therefore I would be wasting additional time in my life to do anymore than I am , but I feel like I might be able to help someone else who very well might be oblivious to the deceptive value of the Uber Eats Corp  and there criminal like unchanging of already extremely high prices of fast food , and general on the go meals they offer , but I will focus on one single incident and that was the meal I elected at a popular sub restaurant Firehouse Sub l, as I contemplated my first meal purchase it was clearly obvious that the option of purchase and delivery of the meal was a out of the question, so I was forced to utilize the pickup option only to get the shock of my life within the arena of fast food ordering since I was new to this form of ordering I chose to wait and place my order within the establishment because my attempts were stiffled with each way I tried to make the order complete and it seemed as if I was doing something incorrectly because the price was so much more than that of the establishment had I ordered it as I always had with cash so once at Firehouse it became clear that the ordering process would be much more different than I could've ever imagined, but I had paid nothing for the Uber card and yet I found it difficult to continue with the order once I realized that the pizza meatball sub that I love so much had a surcharge amount additional to its original price and for what I have found to be nothing more than a sheer luxury of having a plastic card with the Uber logo upon it because just days earlier I had this exact same meal of sandwich and soda was roughly $17.42 was now costing me $22.47 it was clear that the privilege of having the opportunity to purchase the meal with the stylish and sleek design of the Uber Eats card was just a mere 5 dollars and 5 cent which ultimately was nothing at all seeing that the card in hand made me feel as if I was the late Anthony Bourdain deep within the üáÆüáπ Italy on a dangerous excursion in search of the perfect slices of pepperoni,  even though I was merely deep within the hills and my very own nightmare of the great state of West Virgina on a cols tuesday night , Uber Eats should be ashamed of themselves but i grant you there anything but!!!!!

"After waiting over an hour for food from a restaurant that is a) fast food and 2)less than 10 minute drive from my home, I contacted uber and they refunded my order. The issue I have is the a hole driver who was waiti by at the restaurant where my food was ready for ages, hoping he would get more pick ups from same place. When I contacted him via text, he ignored my question as to when I can expect collection and why a 10-15minute delay was being added to my delivery time that went from 17:50 to 18:35. When i later text back to say ‚Äòyou keep delaying my order‚Äô his response was ‚Äòyes‚Äô. This thieving sc um knew exactly what he was doing because when I then contacted uber (finally able to get to a human via chat after 10 mins of frustratingly trying) the agent cancelled my order without a fee and at that EXACT moment, my order got collected from the Barnsley peel st KFC. I have no idea if the drivers can track or get notified when you speak to an agent, but its a great coincidence that the moment my order got cancelled he suddenly collects it. I hope he chokes on it and the haram food he steals from customers comes back to find him. I will never use uber eats again ever and have told my family to do same, this incident was on my mums uber account as we were at hers and the kids wanted a treat.

"I placed an ordered through UBER Eats for my mother today from Arby's Glendale location mind you it was $68 plus a $12 tip.

So I contacted Uber Eats Customer Service and the female was very attentive plus she reimburse us with Uber Cash. This is the kicker, this Wynona had the audacity to say that she dropped the food off at an apartment building, first of all, I do not stay in an apartment building and I told that representative that her ass need to be fired, when you decided that you wanted to steal from my mother, now I want to give her a beat down.

"The Customer Service Team is absolutely shocking, what has happened in the world for the customer experience not to be at the forefront of a company's agenda. As soon as I ordered my meal this morning little did I know the aggro I would get over the next couple of hours, I would rather have gone hungry if I'd have known. Only half of my food arrived, I presumed after calling the team I would either get it sent to me again (wishful thinking) or get a refund. I got a quarter of my refund owed to me. After ringing back due to their mistake, and after speaking to the manager she could not do anything else for me. They had a guideline to follow and that was that and as they had refunded a small amount back they couldnt do anymore. I asked how was a guideline being followed when the majority of my items had not been delivered and also not refunded. The manager should not have this title!So not only did I lose out on food this morning I also lost money. I would never use this company for anything ever again; that is how shocked I feel with regards to their aftercare. They need to re-think their stratagy in what they are hoping to achieve and complete re-training.

The same thing has happened with Uber, I placed an order last night for mcdonalds around 7.20, by 8.45 the order had not even been collected by the courier, i had 4 different drivers assigned and they all cancelled, eventually after a very long wait i got to speak to someone on live chat who cancelled my order and as a 'gesture of goodwill' cancelled the charge (they tried to charge me the full food order to cancel?!) it really is unacceptable, i'm diabetic and i was really needing to eat at this point, almost 9pm and still no food. I had to make a microwave meal in desperation/quickness. They gave me a ¬£5 voucher because my order guarantee time was missed which i've (stupidly) used again this morning on breakfast, thinking, surely, breakfast at 11am is not going to be terribly busy from an independent little shop in town centre, apparently so, i'm still waiting and a driver has not been assigned again (after 3 already cancelling so far) i honestly will never use UE again. estimated delivery time from my order is now 12.45, ridiculous. it's not even the drivers necessarily who are at fault here, something is very very wrong.","Date of experience: December 08, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JE,Trust Pilot

Once my order was pushed through and I checked the receipt there was no promo or discount applied at all. I called right away and was instructed to send a screen shot of the promo code from my email to be refunded. I followed up after not hearing back within 48 hours. 4 days later I still had zero response so I called back. I was told there was an issue in their system and the code has been de-activated which is hilarious because the promotion is still being advertised in my app while I type this ...on the phone call I was told that I could not be transfered to a manager or supervisor as non were available since they were all busy helping other users. I offered to wait and said I did not want to get off the phone until I had a refund resolution as I really need the funds back. I was told that the case had to be escalated to a special team and that id hear back in 1-2 days. I've wasted over 3 hours of my time trying to get money back that I am owed. I would have never placed the order if I didn't receive the promo code. UBER EATS SCAMMING PEOPLE. For this 3rd phone call, after being on the phone trying to advocate for myself for over 40 mins I was hung up on by the rep. I cannot contact support via chat in the app or report an issue in the app because anytime I try to it just goes to the help center articles with no other option to contact anyone or submit any issue.

"Had a fraudulent $1.2k order placed on my account from Texas (we live in Canada and have NO relations to Texas), and none of the: 'premium' support, Uber support Twitter account or reaching out directly within the app/site helped. I spent OVER a week reiterating the issue with representatives of their team (new ones every time since they never stay connected to support chats/emails/DMs), and was told every single time that I would either: a) get a report filed to get assistance from their technical support team, b) that someone I knew must have been using my account and that it was a miscommunication, or c) that they looked into the order and came to the conclusion that the purchase was 100% valid. The absolute BEST their customer service did was: offer $15 in credit....I mean, honestly. My family has TWO separate uber one accounts and we will be cancelling all and deleting our accounts. If you're ever concerned about security, and how customer services may help you with it -- they won't.

Obviously you are going to deliver the food you get the best pay on first. Since deleting my Uber eats app and changing service, i have had zero issues. I was shocked at the turn around of service.

"This is the worst customer support and service experience ive had in recent memory. We wasted 2 hours waiting for food (that was never going to come!) and about 20-40 minutes trying to reach an honestly inexcusably bad customer service. All while in between we were being assured that our order is coming and the uber driver changed so we had to wait just a bit longer! Turns out the store was not even open!!! We ordered food from a store that was closed for the day and they kept telling us the order is waiting to be picked up!!! Forgetting about that, imagine that someone does not have enough money to place a new order. The representative did not even give me time to react as he/she proceeded to refund in 3-5 days. Never even asking if that would be okay or giving any other option such as ""add it to my wallet"" so that someone without more money can order straight away. But i guess they don't care if you cant afford another order and cant feed your guests!"". Later I'm met with this cold apathy where the customer service representative doesn't even allow me to get a word in edgewise and proceeds to quickly try and make an excuse in the end that obviously was a lie (since the store told methey were not even open at the time). I had a friend over from abroad that day and we wasted our evening waiting on food to start a movie and hearing excuses and frankly a refusal to communicate by both the store (who again, turned out to be closed) and Uber.

Hi I had a uber driver who never delivered my food and I was charged after making uber aware that I received nothing I was refunded less than half the amount why have I been partially refunded when my whole order was taken by asmaa (uber driver). I would like to make a complaint and will be sharing this experience on all my social platforms. Please can you send me the contact information for the relevant teams who can investigate the driver. They never delivered my food and also the customer services reps who do not know how to read. Its highly frustrating as a uber one customer I am very disappointed the way I have been treated I have lost trust in your services What I would like now is good will for the inconvenience caused by your driver who took my food and then to make matters even worse I have not been heard by your customer service reps who have refunded me partially.

"I recently had a disappointing encounter with Uber Eats that left me frustrated and inconvenienced. Despite placing an order with high expectations, the service abruptly canceled my order without providing any valid reason. The lack of transparency in their decision-making process is highly concerning. This incident not only wasted my time but also disrupted my plans. I expected better from a service that prides itself on convenience. Unfortunately, this experience has left me hesitant to rely on Uber Eats in the future.","Date of experience: December 06, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NE,Trust Pilot

Received the delivery fine however Uber then changed the amount payable to full payment. When questioned they advised it was only for certain shops. Have proved the code works at the same shop and now they are choosing to ignore any messages sent. The error is on them and they don't want to acknowledge it or sort it out.

"Horrendous service. We'd not had a knock at the door and it was 20 mins late so I went to ring up to ask what was happening and saw a text saying it had been delivered. When I went in to the app it showed a pic of a McD's bag next to our shed in the garden. I went and retrieved it from the far end of our back garden. So the lad had walked through our gate into the back garden and rather than walk the further 15 paces or so to the house door they just left it there next to some rubble and breezeblocks. I rang to get a refund and the lad said he couldn't give a refund because it had been delivered on time! Even though he'd not gone anywhere near our house (the place he actually was meant to deliver it to!) and the delivery hadn't been done he said he was unable to refund because if its on time then that makes it fine! He didn't seem to want to allow me to take it further as after 3 times of asking he'd still not told me what the complaints process was and/or how we could discuss this with a manager (at McD's or Uber Eats). I've had loads of deliverys with them before but neither our family or any of our close friends/family will be ordering from them again. The worst thing is I tipped them before the delivery on the app, what a mug! If I could I've have given 0/5 as this was not worthy of a point and their response to my phone call about the delivery makes them even worse. Well they're now going to miss out on a lot of money though being out of order because I'm letting everyone know how poor this is and never to order from Uber Eats.","Date of experience: December 06, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JS,Trust Pilot

"Really the worst kind of customer service you could possibly have. The app made an error and added an extra item for me that I couldn't remove and this extra item was charged to me. Trying to get this taken care of, to refund a single item, has been a kafkaesque nightmare of the highest order. They have a chat bot first you need to get past which keeps kicking you out of the chat, then when you finally get to a representative they keep giving the same answers and saying they can't do anything, all the while making you wait for ages. Finally after spending close to half an hour of your precious time trying to get an error caused by THEIR app to be fixed, they say they will forward it to a team who will get back to you and close the chat in your face. Almost every 2nd time I make an order with this company I regret it. Then I promise myself I won't order with them again, and usually I last 2-3 months or so of not ordering with them, but then I kind of forget how bad it is and make an order, and then it turns out, it's not just as bad, it's worse each time!

I said let me talk to a manager. She said sure I can do that but they‚Äôre going to give you the same information I am. I said, so it‚Äôs a dead end solution you‚Äôre giving me? And she responded yes. She said the Uber driver can take the food if declined and told me to read under the terms and use of Uber eats. I said this can‚Äôt possibly be what‚Äôs written under Uber eats terms? Management later called me and said the same thing. Useless and not helpful. They said the driver tried to contact me.

I will never use Uber eats again. The company are scammers.They use the pending method to scam customers. It is an I.T glitch which they are taking advantage of to fraud customers and gaining double payments for the one transaction. My account was debited on day of transaction which went into pending on my mobile banking app! That reflected on my balance on that day for the goods. Then 5 days later my balance decreases again for the exact same amount. I contacted my bank and they advised me that only one payment has gone out to Uber eats however my remaining balance monies does not reflect that. Please be aware this is a loophole in the system an It glitch which they have cottoned onto Uber eats are fraudulently taking extra money from their customers without their knowledge and without their consent. I will never use the company again and I strongly recommend that no one else should unless they want to fall prey like me and be double charged for the same items. Absolute con company no wonder they are such a wealthy organisation when they are pulling stunts like this.One extremely unhappy customer,"Date of experience: December 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,RR,Trust Pilot
"The service is terrible! I have had a number of small issues, but the one that tipped me over the edge was yesterday. Me and my wife had our first child and needed to order some essentials. I placed the order and was informed it would be here within 30 mins. Roughly an hour later, nothing. Called the shop where my order was being collected, they stated the delivery person attempted to call and deliver but bought the shopping back. So I call Uber eats customer service line to be informed that the driver tried contacting me and waited 7 minutes for me. This is not true at all!! I have no missed calls on my mobile device or voice messages. No one pulled up outside our house or knocked! So I had to leave my wife who was still recovering from the birth with our little one and get the essentials. Awful service, awful customer service. This needs to be addressed if they want to keep running. I will not be using this service again and recommend others don‚Äôt either.","Date of experience: December 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Peter Lodge,Trust Pilot

"After years of giving Ubereats loyal and frequent service, I have finally decided to stop using it cold turkey. I advise avoiding  Ubereats unless you have no other option. They are notoriously bad at refunding legitimate mistakes on their end (ex. missing items, wrong items, and legitimate safety concerns). I have let these things slide over the past year(I really should have stopped using their service months ago).  But this past couple months with mistake after mistake and not being refunded, I was basically throwing money in the trash can. Yesterday was the final straw for me. I chipped a tooth on the food I ordered on the app (there was something hard in the dish that shouldn't have been in it). I had to throw it away and now deal with a chipped tooth which is more time and money and an overall upsetting experience. I explained the situation to Ubereats and they did not refund me one penny for this order that cost me almost 50 bucks that went in the trash and resulted in a chipped tooth. I will no longer use Ubereats. Additionally their customer service is awful, they do not help you with legitimate concerns or do any investigations when it comes to safety, they did not even refund me for this situation at all.","Date of experience: December 02, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DC,Trust Pilot

"Uber Eats Ôøº Can we talk about how poor Uber eats customer service really is on Friday Dec 1. I ordered from Wingstop and immediately contacted them to cancel my order because I got a call from my sister saying that my mom has had a heart attack so I went to cancel it so I can go to her. The first thing I tried to do was just to cancel it in general, but I had to use the chat bot thing in order to do that, so it asked me what are the reasons why that I am canceling my order and I said that I ordered it by mistake because we didn‚Äôt really have an option for saying that you had a family emergency so I just put it as a mistake, but it wouldn‚Äôt take it and the app kept bugging like it was delaying everything so I just ended up asking for a representative to speak to, an actual person they contacted me with was Nanci. Mind you before Nanci even got on the chat. It took an incredibly long time, maybe five minutes before I even got in contact with her and then as I was talking to her explaining as to why I went to cancel my order her replies took at least 2 to 4 minutes now I worked customer service for a very long time and I know how to cancel orders it doesn‚Äôt take 2 to 3 minutes or 2 to 4 minutes to get on the chat and be like hey I can totally do that for you. It doesn‚Äôt take that long so then after I dealt with her and got fed up with Her, she referred me to some team that could further help me but that team response would‚Äôve took 6 to 12 hours. Why would it take 6 to 12 hours for them to cancel our order? By the time that it would take 6 to 12 hours my order would already be there and I wouldn‚Äôt be home, so I called customer service they weren‚Äôt any better. I called them and they had me on hold for 11 to probably 18 minutes and then I got in contact with Nel or Mel I can‚Äôt remember which one but it was one of those two and she put me on hold probably like two or three times and was saying how they can‚Äôt give they can‚Äôt cancel my order because the food was already in route. But if they would‚Äôve canceled it from the gecko, the food would not have been in route, so they purposely delayed and stalled in order for my food to go out so they wouldn‚Äôt have to cancel so they could still get money. So then I asked her if I could speak to her supervisor and she replied how they would say the exact same thing to me as she did and how they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get in contact in contact with me for at least 24 hours so then I asked her for her employee ID number, she said they‚Äôre not allowed to give those out. I think asked for her last name and she wouldn‚Äôt give me it either. Then I heard back from another lady I can‚Äôt remember her name but I do have screenshots of everything so I will be inserting that into the post but she  contacted me and said that she saw that my food has already been delivered and there‚Äôs nothing else they can do.they purposely stall you so they don‚Äôt have to cancel it so we don‚Äôt have to get money back and they want your money. They don‚Äôt care if your food is on the way or not I highly highly highly suggest not ordering from them no more unless you want to get scammed constantly.Again please don‚Äôt order from them! They‚Äôre horrible and only want your money! They don‚Äôt care about customers service at all! Please spread the word!","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KA,Trust Pilot

"They never deliver the whole order and when you try to contact support, it takes you to an automated voice message that provides no help. Even though their delivery service providers or partner restaurants screw up the order, Uber takes no responsibility and provides the bare minimum as a refund to customers. There is no mechanism to counter this and get in touch with their customer support to understand what happened and come to a proper resolution. Overall, Uber functions like a scam and their only job is to scam innocent customers out of their money. More than a few times I have placed orders with Uber where I only received a partial delivery and I had to waste additional time in order to get any kind of a resolution. Recently, I ordered a pretty expensive meal and half of the things on the list were not delivered. I tried to get in touch with the Uber delivery person & customer support and there was no response. I got a partial refund, CHF 15 less than what I should have been refunded and when I tried to get additional help on this issue, I was just getting redirected to the page where it said Uber had already refunded me. There is no recourse. This is really a scam guys. It is better to order locally and directly from the restaurants rather than pay Uber. There are absolutely no benefits.

I used them after just eat and Deliveroo was a disappointment now Uber eat fall just like them. Ordered groceries waited 2 hours then the driver picked up the food and cancelled it.No refund straight away you have to wait days to get your money back and they didn‚Äôt refund the service fee + delivery + bags. How dodgy went the company now they don‚Äôt help you with your past order and grocery orders. Will never order again. How said there‚Äôs no reasons from them here.

"I used to order food often from Uber Eats. It was by far my most used app for food in general. Today they lost themselves a customer.Not only the platform is extremely unreliable and inaccurate on its estimates (ETAs) ‚Äî which means your 20 min order easily becomes 1h ‚Äî but trying to solve an issue with your order is nearly impossible.Customer support is nonexistent. Whatever they call a ‚Äúhelp centre‚Äù takes ages to respond, which means there‚Äôs no addressing an ongoing or recent order. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a response, they‚Äôll simply automatically apply whatever solution sounds best for their business rather than for the customer, therefore simply ignoring the problem itself and dismissing your concerns. My order was ridiculously wrong, which I realised as soon as I entered my apartment. I tried reaching out and it took them almost a full day to get back to me. So there was no returning the order, no getting a new order or ordering something else. No option. The only thing I had was a ‚Äúwait for our response‚Äù, which in turn came through an automated solution that I did not agree to. But here‚Äôs the catch: even if you don‚Äôt agree to the solution, they‚Äôll just go ahead and do it anyway because they don‚Äôt care what you think. After that, good luck trying to get anything else done. The case is closed. And so is my account now.","Date of experience: November 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GA,Trust Pilot

"I am compelled to share my horrendous experience with Uber Eats, and the lack of customer support has left me utterly frustrated.I recently placed an order through Uber Eats, and to my dismay, the food never arrived. The order mysteriously vanished from my 'past orders' on the app, leaving me in a state of confusion. Desperate for assistance, I embarked on a futile journey to seek support.I tried reaching out through three different phone numbers, three email addresses, and even attempted to navigate the unhelpful website and app. Unfortunately, none of these avenues provided the assistance I needed. The app couldn't locate my order, and every time I managed to connect with a human, I was transferred to a different department, only to have the line abruptly disconnect.Feeling exasperated and out of options, I resorted to creating a Twitter account just to seek support. It is disheartening that I had to resort to such measures to address a simple issue with my order.The most frustrating part of this ordeal is the apparent intentional difficulty Uber imposes on customers seeking a refund. The lack of a streamlined support system and the constant runaround from one department to another is unacceptable.Uber Eats needs to seriously reevaluate its customer support infrastructure to ensure that customers can easily and efficiently resolve issues. No one should have to jump through such hoops just to address a missing order and seek a refund.I sincerely hope Uber Eats takes notice of this review and implements improvements in their customer support system. As it stands, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I caution others to be wary of relying on Uber Eats for their food deliveries.","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,William Bones,Trust Pilot

"I am writing this complaint review to express my extreme frustration with the difficulty I encountered while trying to reach Uber's customer service. As a loyal customer, I expected a smooth and efficient process, but unfortunately, my recent experience left me feeling incredibly dissatisfied.Firstly, it took an unreasonable amount of time and effort to even get through to a representative. The long wait times and constant automated messages only added to my frustration. When I finally connected with a customer service agent, the language barrier became immediately apparent. The representative I spoke to did not have a strong command of English, which made it incredibly challenging to communicate my issue effectively.The most frustrating part of the conversation was when I had to provide my email address. Despite spelling it out phonetically multiple times, the representative seemed unable to comprehend or accurately record the information. I had to repeat my email address over seven times, which was not only time-consuming but also incredibly inefficient.Furthermore, I am deeply disappointed with Uber's refusal to refund my order. The food I received was stone cold, likely due to being delivered on a bicycle in freezing temperatures. This not only compromised the quality of the meal but also posed a potential health risk.As a customer, I expect to be treated with respect and to receive assistance from knowledgeable representatives who can understand and address my concerns effectively. Unfortunately, this experience with Uber's customer service fell far short of my expectations.I hope that Uber takes this feedback seriously and takes steps to improve their customer service and refund policy. It is essential for a company of their stature to provide efficient and effective support to their customers, especially when issues like food quality and delivery conditions arise.","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MJ,Trust Pilot

When I went to check-out the promotion was removed and then I received an error message saying the promotion was now invalid and was completely removed from my account. I have NEVER had this issue before so I attempted to reach out to customer service where I was spoken to very rude, my concerns were not resolved, I was not allowed to speak with a manager and then I was hung up on.

I know for a fact the other order wasn't far away but I don't know the address so couldn't swap it back but your driver can't be asked to fix the mistake he made. I'm getting fed up with taken a risk with Uber eats. I get missing items, wrong items or you just don't deliver the food and then put on the app it's been delivered. Sort it out. I don't understand how some of the workers managed to keep their jobs with making so many mistakes. I'm in a terrible amount of pain but now I need to quickly sort out dinner for my kids before bedtime. This is so unfair, waiting around for this. I'm so disappointed. I hope you never get gallstones so can't  experience the pain I'm in. This has putting me in the hospital multiple times due to the pain making feel like I can't breathe.

"If the order is processed as expected and you get your food, great. If things go wrong be prepared to say goodbye to your payment and/or your food. The customer service is non-existent with Uber eats. They make it very difficult to resolve any issues - the agent will stick to a script regardless. The restaurant called me to say they didn't have the item I had ordered. They offered me the choice to order something else or request a refund via Uber eats. I opted for a refund. Mistake. Uber eats refused to engage with me. So be prepared to lose your money if the restaurant doesn't have what you order. The app is deliberately set up to minimise any customer service contact that you can have with them. Each time I sent a message and got a minimal response, I was requested to rate the response but it disappeared when I clicked on it. Possibility that the agent did this to avoid low scores. Avoid at all costs. Just Eat has better scores.","Date of experience: November 29, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SA,Trust Pilot

First time ordering a delivery from Macdonalds Cumbernauld G67 using uber eats. Food arrived quick . Some Food was missing from my order and on inspection of the bag there was a hole ripped behind the label big enough to remove Food. Contacted Macdonalds to complain and was fobbed off and told to contact Uber eats. After an hour I got ¬£1.37 refunded  .Some delivery driver had his hands in my Food and Macdonalds and Uber are not interested .

I used Uber eats for a delivery when I was out of town in a hotel. My order was wrong and I had no utensils to eat with. I called the restaurant straight away as they are the ones who messed up my order. They told me to call back the next day to speak with a manager about my refund as it was about to close. When I finally got a hold of him he stated I had to get a refund from Uber eats as that‚Äôs who I paid and they would go to the restaurant. I then started contacting them and they didn‚Äôt want to refund my order. They only refunded me part of what was missing and then told me I was past the refund time. I explained I was in contact with the restaurant at first as I thought they were who messed up my order but then I did contact Uber eats. And if I was past the refund time why did they refund $12 of the $50 order then. That was an insult. I won‚Äôt use Uber eats again.

"I am compelled to leave this one-star review after a truly frustrating experience with Uber Eats. After placing an order, our delivery person spent 30 minutes unsuccessfully searching for our building. Despite my attempts to assist through phone calls and in-app messaging, she left without delivering our meal. To add insult to injury, when I cancelled the order due to this confusion, Uber Eats retained my payment instead of issuing a refund. My efforts to explain the situation fell on deaf ears as their customer service showed a complete lack of empathy and understanding. This experience not only left us without dinner but unfairly out of pocket too.

"I have been a loyal paying customer to Uber Eats for several years & they have been so unprofessional with their basic generic customer responses in my most recent order issue that I raised with them.I placed an order & there was a missing item so I raised it with them via their help chat within the app, I was then attacked for raising similar issues with previous orders (due to those restaurants making errors either missing / wrong / damaged items - that is not on me that‚Äôs on them for not doing their job properly! Also my current order issues have nothing to do with any previous order issues!)I was then told they wouldn‚Äôt refund the missing item because I have multiple duplicate accounts claiming promos for new customers which I have never done.Half the time their promos don‚Äôt apply to the restaurants I use!At this point the meal was already ruined because the fries were missing from the meal deal, I no longer care about the refund‚Ä¶ I am now concerned that someone has created multiple accounts in my name & why have I never been notified of this until now when I have been a loyal paying customer for several years?!They‚Äôre happy to take my money with additional service & delivery fees on top which I don‚Äôt mind paying if they actually deliver what I ordered!I only have one Uber Eats account in my name, email address, home address, phone number & payment details so why are they allowing others to get away with creating multiple accounts in another person‚Äôs name then asking me to write to them with details of said duplicate accounts so they can delete them from the system?! I didn‚Äôt create them so how on earth can I email you details of them to delete them?! Absolutely ridiculous! This should‚Äôve been raised initially when it occurred so they could close accounts fraudulently using another customer‚Äôs name / details!I even tried to speak with Uber UK Support on Twitter & they were just as useless giving generic robotic responses!They‚Äôre not even listening to the issues the customer is raising & now they seemingly no longer care about duplicate accounts they mentioned to me as they‚Äôre claiming their team has ‚Äúresolved the issue‚Äù‚Ä¶ NO THEY HAVE NOT!!!They didn‚Äôt refund the missing item & are not clarifying details about these so-called ‚Äúmultiple duplicate accounts‚Äù in my name.You can‚Äôt even contact them by phone to speak to someone who can listen & understand what the issues are to even begin resolving them! It‚Äôs so messed up‚Ä¶ take your money & service elsewhere!You can‚Äôt blame customers for the failures of the restaurants who use your service, yes mistakes happen & things get forgotten or damaged etc (human error), but it happens too frequently with restaurants & Uber Eats don‚Äôt pull them up on it & instead attack their paying customers.They never used to be like this if there was an issue.If I was to dine in a restaurant & they messed up the order I would‚Äôve obviously be refunded so when I order a takeout the restaurants / Uber Eats should do the same. Restaurants should be held accountable if they mess up an order that is paid for. Don‚Äôt blame the customer because staff aren‚Äôt doing their job properly. Disgusting unprofessional behaviour!Update:They replied 3 days later to apologise & as a ‚Äúgoodwill gesture‚Äù gave a full refund.I didn‚Äôt ask for a full refund, I only wanted a refund for the missing item I was reporting. It‚Äôs the principle of the matter. I guess due to the situation being handled so badly they decided to give a full refund which I appreciate.However, when I tried to enquire further about those so-called ‚Äúmultiple duplicate accounts‚Äù I just got generic responses again & no further details.

"I recently placed an order with Amigos Feltham through Uber Eats, and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. The delivery was not only extremely late but also arrived cold, prompting me to have to use the microwave to heat up my food. To add to the frustration, the milkshake included in the order had spilled inside the bag.Upon contacting Uber and providing photographic evidence of the issues, the response I received was less than satisfactory: ""We will be unable to provide a refund on this occasion. We understand that these issues do arise on occasion, but not often at this regularity.""I'm puzzled by the term ""regularity"" used here, and frankly, I don't comprehend Uber's decision. In a highly competitive food delivery industry where numerous alternatives exist, it's essential for platforms to prioritize customer satisfaction. If this is the level of service and understanding offered by Uber, it's crucial for them to recognize that customers wield significant influence.

"We order through UberEats a lot because Deliveroo is not available in our area. On a regular basis items are missing, completely inedible, or spilled/damaged. Given my experience with UberEats customer service in the past, I don't even bother claiming inedible food anymore and I just deal with it. Missing items, however, is a different story.We order at least a few times a week - sometimes small items like coffees, other times meals. Regularly a few companies (mainly McDonalds and Starbucks) do not send items. I claim them back in the app, and up until a month ago I was refunded for these items. In the last month every order I make requires a PIN, and when I tried to claim back a simple ¬£2.39 donut that was not in the bag, I was unable to. Customer support then told me that ""we have seen that a number of orders have received price adjustments or credits"" and refused to refund me.Yes, indeed, because they were legitimately missing items. I reached out to their customer support again and again and just get a canned response over and over. No refund, despite them taking money for an item. I feel like I'm being treated as a fraudster when I regularly put up with cancelling drivers, lackluster delivery service, delayed service, and missing or terrible items.We never get any compensation for a bad driver, or a driver who is clearly picking up other orders despite our order being ready. However whenever we have a problem there's radio silence and it's somehow our fault.This is basically theft. How can I prove in a photo something is missing? Shall I take a photo of an empty countertop or an empty hand or bag? Given the amount of orders and money spent, the maths works out that I'd have a higher number of claims. Maybe UberEats needs to look at investigating restaurants which can't seem to fulfill orders or properly update their system when sending the order out that an item was missing, instead of spending time calling customers liars.If UberEats doesn't like providing legitimate refunds, and doesn't want to have decent customer support because they're in what they feel is a high fraud business, then maybe they need to rethink their business altogether.","Date of experience: November 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MW,Trust Pilot

"Should be zero stars. We placed an Uber Eats order. After the driver got lost multiple times on his way here, we finally tracked him down by walking to where he was. He handed over the bag and was on his way. Lo and behold, it was someone else‚Äôs food. We called him to return. He‚Äôd already delivered our Nando‚Äôs to the people who‚Äôd ordered the prawns that we received. Plus the prawns were supposed to have been delivered 40 minutes prior to our receipt of them. We gave him back the wrong food and tried contacting Uber. They don‚Äôt have a good way of contacting them as all we kept getting was a bot response telling us to enjoy our order. After finally getting hold of someone via chat, they said they‚Äôd reverse the charges. What happened instead is our credit card got charged a second time.

"I have been an Uber Eats customer for a couple of years and have enjoyed the discount promotion and convenience. Uber Eats was great until you need to contact their customer service.  They will have the same response over and over again, and you need to repeat your issue over and over again.A few weeks ago I got an error message when I tried to activate a promotion offer, I contacted Uber Eats help line and was told that my account was restricted from using promotion because I violate their terms and conditions. I had no idea what I did wrong and none of them were able to tell me.  After about a dozen of calls and emails, someone from their priority support team was able to fix it temporary. It went well for a week and then my account was restricted from using promotion again.  After back and forth a few times, I kept getting the same response that system put a restriction to apply promotion because there is a breach of Uber Eats terms and conditions. Again they couldn't find anything to show that I have done anything wrong. I asked for the priority support team and was told there's no such team!!  Finally I got to speak with a Uber manager and was told that they will do an investigation. I asked if someone will get back to me when the investigation is completed. She said no but I can call to follow up. She said they will close my ticket as nothing more they can do. They reassure me that I can still order but without any promotion for the time being.  I was shocked to find that they said they will investigate but will not get back to the customer","Date of experience: November 23, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JC,Trust Pilot

Used to order Uber Eats after a long hiatus. The experience was very convenient. It's picks up the nearest restaurant and provides the menu to choose with all the customize options. The delivery was also very prompt. Two points which need work. There is a lot of premium above the price. The price of the dish has a premium. The delivery fee and the tip gets added making the overall experience very unattractive. The second point is that there was a promo applicable but it did not apply.

The driver messaged me that he picked up my order but it was the wrong order & then asked for my code to close out the delivery because he wasn't able to remove it & close it without my code. Well, I said no. I had been charged for the dessert, delivery, & tip & wasn't going to receive what I purchased.

Eventually something in your Chatbot changed (.5hrs later) & I was allowed to chat with a human who said they would cancel the order & I would receive full refund. Thankfully, after eating 45 min of my time on a dessert i never got I did receive a full refund.i do not see myself trying your service ever again.

AS previously mentioned as the warehouse is close to our house, we went there to ask for more information on the driver, however they said they could not provide it and we needed to reach out to UBER directly, as it was very late we were not able to get any help from Uber.

"UberEats has just been great overall. Actually, since I started using UberEats, I completely stopped using DoorDash. Part of it is that I have the UberOne membership, and another is that they seem to offer more deals toward purchases. The overall service I get is also a lot better. For example, my orders are most often brought directly to my door (even though I live on the 4th floor), and this NEVER happened with DoorDash. Regardless of delivery instructions, Doordash would often call when they were approaching and request that I come downstairs to meet them. UberEats typically only calls if they're having trouble locating my address (which has only happened once) and they always follow my delivery instructions.

"Uber Eats are sham and a scam. Uber Ones is a monthly (or annual) ostensibly premium subscription fee service. Except there is a steep minimum order to qualify for the free delivery and discounted service that you pay additionally for monthly/annually.They also routinely let you down but making you wait for over an hour (this is often the service given to those who aren't Uber One subscribers) only to be told there is no driver available. One time it was almost two hours after wasting my time that they basically said, 'Sorry, no dice'.Drivers are often listed as being in modes of transport they're not using, and frequently the person delivering does not match the photo. Recently I was informed it was an asian woman on a push bike, only for an old asian guy to turn up. At least I got my order, but still, it's unprofessional.Getting a refund from Uber Eats is often problematic. You always have to jump through hoops via the app before you might get a refund, and often they refuse to issue one. So, I suggest that anyone who does considering paying in advance (because that's the modus operandi of this alleged service), that they use their credit card, and block any payments where Uber Eats aren't willing to refund for issues.Some drives steal your order. I literally had a driver turn up tonight with none of the three meals I ordered, just the drinks. When asked where the meals were, he replied, 'Sorry, they only gave me this bag', and as if to somehow prove this beyond doubt, showed the inside of the insulated bag. Because he couldn't have possibly removed the meal bag(s) and left them inside his car before knocking on my door.Lastly, Uber Eats is a strange faceless organisation, and there poor service underpins this cold, distant impersonal business. Avoid, trial Uber One, but never subscribe to/pay for it.","Date of experience: November 15, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Frank84,Trust Pilot

"The delivery has been as expected with my first and second order with UberEats. My best recommendation for users is to add as much stuff you want or need per order, so you get more delivered for the same price. First time got three days worth of Chinese food. Second time only ordered one thing. Noticed the delivery fee was the same for 8 items as it was for one. So best advice is compile a list and get as much as you can order at one time, makes the delivery cost go down per item, same end cost.

I will never use Uber Eats again. This company is run by cowboys. You cannot speak to anyone if you have an issue. Our order was cancelled because the driver claimed he tried to contact us and waited out side for over 7 minutes and we didn't contact him. This is utter lies. He was not there when I went outside. He would not answer his phone and the tracker showed him to be no where near our house. He didn't ring the door bell or knock at the door or call me. Uber eats have charged us and will not engage. They keep saying the driver waited even though I have told them I have proof he didn't. They have also tried to say my address was wrong but that is also lies.

"UberEats is the WORST delivery service in the UK. Highly recommended using Deliveroo or JustEat as their customer service is fair when things go wrong. UberEats just sends automated message after automated message, regardless of the situation. Don't waste your money or your time with them, but if you already have and aren't getting what you need - I recommend doing a chargeback through your bank to get your money back. Delete the app! I ordered food, restaurant began preparing it, driver was assigned, driver was cancelled, yet I received the stone cold food almost an hour later despite the PROMISE TIME being 32 minutes prior to its arrival. It went straight in the bin, disgusting. But the ""customer service"" was the worst part of the whole experience.

Uber eats refused to give me a refund for a double charged order. I sent an order and right after a minute I realized that I have to add more to the order because the buy 1 get 1 wouldn't applied automatically if yoou don't order 2 of the same item so I cancelled it right away and re ordered the same exact things. Just added a drink The ordered wasn't even started preparing yet when I cancelled. And then later on I realized that they charged me double with 2 diffferent amounts. So I was gonna asked for help on the chat but there was message saying that i have a pending charge and have to wait 5-10days to solve the issue. So i waited for few days and when I followed up they said that 48 hours have passed so there's no way I can get my money back. But they knew that I was charged twice fir tge same order.

"Don't do it. You can't review restaurants - even though you see some reviews listed - they are usually just good ones. There is no way to write one of your own, so I don't know where they get the ones you see. Nor is there any way listed to contact Uber customer service, even though I belong to Uber One. You seem to have to go through their twitter page, and I'm not joining that mess just to contact them. You shouldn't have to search all over the place to find a way to contact them, it should be right on the app page and easy to find. It's a rip-off and a joke. Most of my orders come botched. Even when rating a restaurant with the thumbs up or down, they really don't let you give an accounting of why you're giving a thumbs down, they just give a few suggestions from which to choose. The prices are way too high, restaurants have really taken advantage of pandemic pricing, it's gross. Even though I realize Uber doesn't set the prices, the service itself is so crappy it's not worth joining.

"I had an incredibly frustrating experience with Uber Eats recently. I ordered food from Spice Lounge in Erdington to be delivered to Good Hope Hospital for lunch. A female driver was assigned to the job, and initially, I could track her progress. However, the app suddenly stopped working with no notifications or alerts. After restarting my phone, I was shocked to see that the app claimed the food had been delivered, even though I received no communication or confirmation.Desperate for a solution, I contacted Spice Lounge, but they insisted they were not responsible since the food had been picked up. Following their advice, I reached out to Uber support through the app. Unfortunately, my interaction with their support was disheartening, as I received what seemed to be automated, robotic replies. The response continually asserted that the driver waited for 8 minutes and, as a result, I was ineligible for a refund.Now, I find myself out approximately ¬£17 for two Biryani dishes that I never received. To make matters worse, I had to work a shift without any food since there were no other nearby options I could trust for a timely delivery. The overall experience left me deeply dissatisfied with Uber's service. It's disheartening that the company relies on automated AI technology for customer interactions, providing generic responses and showing a lack of accountability.I strongly caution against using Uber Eats and similar services. It seems they prioritize their profits over customer satisfaction, offering subpar service and inadequate customer support. Save yourself the trouble and expense by collecting your own food, ensuring a more reliable and satisfying experience. I, for one, will not be using any Uber service in the future and will discourage my friends and family from doing so as well. waiting for receipt, will update later","Date of experience: November 11, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,A Ahmad,Trust Pilot

So you‚Äôre telling me that it‚Äôs my fault that they keep messing up that badly, missing items and having to offer refunds? Once again, I stated to them that I wasn‚Äôt looking for a refund, but that somebody else had been given my order and I‚Äôd gotten there‚Äôs which must have left them extremely out of pocket given the size of the order! 5 minutes later I got another generic response, saying that they were closing the case now and encouraged me to leave a review about my experience.What an absolute joke this company is, I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre still being aloud to operate when they‚Äôre messing people around like this with such poor customer service.

I filed a complaint, and the chatbot replied that I was charged for cancelling my order, which I did not do, and that there would be no refund. Unsatisfied customer because I paid for food that I never received but was charged for.

It worked last few times. Today, I ordered and the driver called up after half n hour, I instructed on call, asked him to follow the instructions written, messaged him on app. He cancelled the order and left. After all this, when I reported, Uber eats informed me, the records say driver contacted me. And then closed the chat, the only way to reach out to them. I never said driver didn‚Äôt contact me.

So I had to contact the customer service, I told him I have received someone's order and he needs to reorder for me, because I used a ¬£15 off welcome code, if I reorder again, the system won't let me use again this ¬£15 off welcome code. BUT, the Uber customer service simply refunded me and ended the chat by himself! Without even asking if I am happy with the solution he offers!!! And he ended the chat himself while I am still typing! What an unprofessional customer service!!!! And then I reopened more chats, and no one gets back to me.

"I ordered from a local restaurant from Uber Eats for a scheduled delivery about an hour and a half in advance.   The restaurant is only a 10-15 minute drive from my home. An hour before the delivery window approached, I received a notification that the restaurant accepted the order. I called the restaurant. They said there was no future time on the order and they would begin working on it. I asked them to delay it. They called me back a few minutes later and said that the Uber driver would be arriving 40 minutes in advance of the delivery window to pick up the order and they needed to start work on it. I told them I was going to cancel the order.When I got on the app, I was able to cancel the order, but I was informed that because the restaurant had accepted the order and began preparing it, I would be charged so the restaurant could be paid.There was no way Support were going to refund the monies.The problem as I saw it was the app or the Uber Eats process of releasing the order prematurely. I didn't want it early for a cold dinner. There is no way for me to complain to Uber for this issue, thus I must resort to this review to complain and hope that they will fix the process. I won't be using Uber again.","Date of experience: November 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,RD,Trust Pilot

Some are quite unprofessional, poorly dressed and not at all versed in handling items of food e.g they're not kept warm during transit.The list goes on and it as if their motto is ""If you don't like it lump it"".It's quite terrible, more times than not.I find myself thinking gosh, they must know me by name by now, the amount of complaints I've tried to raise.

There is no way to directly contact agents through the app, which refused to aknowledge my issue. Once I Googled a support number, they refused to take my call on the basis that I had no pending orders, so I had to make a call through Uber itseslf and ended up on hold/being transferred for two hours. Instance one, Uber claimed my delivery had arrived but it had never been picked up. Instance two, it was delivered to the wrong place (different resteraunts for each instance), and they refused to give me a refund initially. Each time has been stressful and irritating, neither time did I end up with food. I don't know why I ever assumed ordering through a third party would make things easier, this is clearly a scam, especially because they take a cut of the resteraunt's money.

If your food turns up cold, no chance getting a refund or any help. After saying you want to put a complaint in, they completely ignore you.

"Last night i ordered foods through this app, had to wait longer than expected, the status on the app said that its waiting for a partner to pick it up from the restaurant where we ordered the food, every 10 minutes, the estimated time of delivery got delayed for 10 minutes, and the status didnt change. After 1,5 hour waiting, i texted the guy who is supposed to deliver the foods, and got no response. Then the restaurant called me saying that the delivery partner didnt show up and if i would like to come and pick up the foods myself. 15 min later, I saw the new notification coming from my order saying that part of the order is cancelled, which part? No details! The status keeps saying that its still waiting for the delivery partner to pick up the order. Then i was called by the cs of uber eats she explained that possibly the delivery guy had technical issue blabla and told me that they cancelled my order (so after 2 hours), she assured me that i will get my money refunded (oh what a surprise) isnt it a good news? Then she said, but dont worry you still come to the restaurant to pick up your order? Haha after 2 hours you waited and they cancelled your order and then telling you as if its a rewards to get your money refunded and then tell you to pick up your food, this is a joke, if i want or can pick it up at the restaurant why would i bother to order via ubereats? Completely missing the point of their own service line? We didnt pick the order because its already around 9pm and its raining and we have no bike.

"First and last time I'll use Ubereats.  Food was running 20 minute behind the latest expected time, no big deal it happens, but we were listening out for it.  Got a phonecall with an automated message saying Ubereats driver was trying to contact me, but no option to speak the driver?!My partner went straight out the front door to look for him but no sign.  I got an e-mail receipt 30 seconds later saying the food have been delivered to number 7, I live at number 34 and you could clearly see the correct address on the initial order.  It wasn't in the garden of number 7 either (just across the road from us so we'd have seen a car pull up if that's where it had been left). and the photograph doesn't match the garden of where it was supposedly delivered to.  Despite having photographic evidence of the food being dumped at the wrong address and the driver recording it as being delivered to the wrong house number, Ubereats still refused to refund!Edit: If you order through Paypal you can't open a dispute if you don't receive your order.  Also Uber set up an automated payment on my Paypal, which they didn't cancel once they'd already taken the initial payment, so beware of them taking duplicate transactions.  I'll be closing my account and double checking my bank statements as I don't trust this awful, dishonest company.  Fortunately I was able to get a refund from the restaurant as we order from them regularly (unfortunately they stopped taking orders through Deliveroo hence using Ubereats).  However, I'm shocked at the appalling service from Ubereats, especially being accused of lying and giving the wrong address/phone number on the order.

"They used to have really good customer service but it is now one of the worst experiences I have ever had. It takes ages to get through to a human and then you are met with utter disregard, and individuals who ignore your points, do not address what you are saying or asking for and are wholly unhelpful. My order was repeatedly delayed when they couldn‚Äôt find a driver despite my food being ready which then sat there for over 40 minutes. I asked them to cancel since they couldn‚Äôt deliver it and I was just told to keep waiting and eventually someone will bring it. By this point I had given up and started making myself dinner it had been so long. I continued to ask to cancel and be refunded but the agent was like speaking to a brick wall continually spewing the same rhetoric lacking any real apology or empathy for their shoddy service. He attempted to blame the driver and when I was allocated a driver the app told me that they were actually going to complete another delivery first before bringing my food. By this point my food was surely rock hard but again the customer service agent didn‚Äôt care and when I asked for their name to include in my review they promptly ended the chat with me and didn‚Äôt answer any of my remaining concerns.  By far the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever seen. Their username was msidiq1. Needless to say, my food showed up cold and rock hard and went straight in the bin.

I received only coffee and that one was poured all over bag. I did refund from macies but only ¬£7 so it means ¬£6 I paid for what? For someone pretending that they do they job. Very disappointed. You should refund people who receive damaged or not full stuff. In the end of the day it is driver's duty to make sure that they pick full order I mean check receipt before they goes and bring it not damaged (which in my case driver looked very surprised that I ordered food even he clearly could read on receipt and bag he brought me clearly was only coffee and by the way leaking) unfortunately they do not do refund in my knowledge and this very disappointing as to me it happens way too often.

"4 times in the past 2 weeks my order got cancelled because they failed to find a rider to deliver the order. I live fairly central london, the restaurant is within a few miles. 4 times. I order at 10, the order keeps hanging for 2 hours, no option to cancel, no option to speak to someone. 4th time I place an order at 10:30PM and it's late again, finally I find some customer service phone number they hide from the website like a secret, I explain my order got cancelled after a very long wait in previous 3 nights, please let me know if it will be delivered this time or not. After calling the restaurant, he assures me that it's being prepared and will be delivered. and at 1AM I receive a message that my order could not be delivered. No open restaurants left to order anything. They didn't even bother sending me an automated email to apologize. it is UN-F-BELIEVABLE that these guys still manage to survive.Deliveroo is not great either but probably 100 times better than these guys.

"Horrible business. Their 'merchants' would cancel orders, and essentially scam you into giving them your money. The 'customer service' would treat you like an absolute idiot, and tell you that 'there is nothing they can do' because the order isn't refundable despite the fact 1) I did not get the order 2) it was canceled by the restaurant who initially took 3 hours to even cancel the order because 'their car is broken' (at 11:30PM). To top it off I had to deal with their completely inept 'customer service' whose only answer was a paraphrased ""We‚Äôre sorry to hear that your order didn‚Äôt go as expected, but this order is not eligible for a refund and we can‚Äôt take any further action.

"Uber eats is a great service but can be rather expensive when including the service fee, delivery fee and the obvious extra price hikes on food in comparison to ordering directly from the takeaway. One thing that they have always offered though is discount codes and promotions sent via email promotions, unfortunately it seems that recently these promotions are all pure marketing tactics which include ‚Äúfake‚Äù discounts.I have recently received no fewer than four separate offers for discounts on food delivery with the latest being 50% off which even tempted me to join Uber one to save a little on deliveries as the offer could be used 5 times. Luckily I didn‚Äôt as the promotion along with the previous three is available to use at no stores. After searching for a support number I contacted Uber eats support via X where a team member was happy to help, I confirmed my account details and sent proof of my payment card and eagerly awaited a response. After no reply after a few hours I messaged again‚Ä¶ and again‚Ä¶ and again to continuously be ignored for several days now. I have been searching for contact details on how to make an official complaint regarding false advertisement and marketing but have failed so far, I shall continue to search for any kind of contact details while I enjoy a delicious take away delivered by Deliveroo.","Date of experience: October 31, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MJ,Trust Pilot

"Absolute scam. We ordered McDonald's via the McDonald's App, Uber Eats delivers. We ordered at 7pm, our receipt says 7.02pm so that's when they started making the food and milkshakes. The tracker said 3 times it was looking for a new driver. This went on until 7:30 when a driver was finally assigned, saying it would be delivered at 7:45 because he had to deliver to someone else first. Obviously the food arrived stone cold and milkshakes melted. We phoned customer service who were no help at all and seem to think because they delivered within 55 minutes there's not an issue. We paid ¬£27 for food and drinks that were inedible. They said they can't refund us, get in touch with McDonald's. McDonald's said it's Uber Eats that need to refund. Round and round in circles we went, Uber Eats refused a refund because they're following their ridiculous ""policy"".

Only accepted to refund missing item within 15 days, but weren‚Äôt doing anything about the cold food despite us refusing to eat it and telling them to send the driver back to collect it. They were patronising towards my mother; they asked me to read the order number out but when trying to see which number it was my mother beat me to it.

"I used Uber to order a set menu from KFC (New Lynn) that included 16 pieces of chicken. A number of chickens that are not usually counted.  I was hungry so I started eating right away. That day, I looked into the bucket and saw a lot of chicken wings. I got annoyed and counted how many chicken wings there were, and I found out that the total number of chickens was 14. With the mindset that I had to contact Uber quickly, I stopped eating even though I couldn't even eat two, took a picture to keep as evidence, and started writing a complaint. Meanwhile, the chickens, chips and potato gravy I ordered were all cold. It's winter, so the food gets cold while it's being delivered to your house. Can't you imagine what the hot food will be like after all the time it took to take out all the chickens in the bucket, arrange them side by side so they can be seen clearly in the photo, take pictures, and write the application form. I was so irritated that all desire to eat disappeared. I threw away all that food. And asked for a refund. The above is all included in the message I wrote while requesting help from Uber. Uber's response came the next day, not the same day. The result was truly shocking. Refund NZ$7.41. Could it be that the price of two chickens is NZ$7.41? So refund this price??  Uber's action to end the situation by only returning the price of two chickens. This is so absurd. I ended up violating my right to enjoy the food I ordered using Uber, but they don't seem to feel sorry at all. Don't try to solve problems like this, where consumers are harmed and where it is not the consumer's fault at all. Don't fool consumers like this.

I'M DONE WITH UBER EATS FOR GOOD THIS TIME!I am a LOYAL uber eats customer (actually WAS after this)I have had trouble with them a lot this week but gave another chance. Today was the last straw. I ordered from co-op through card. My phone glitched which is out of my control so while waiting for my order I  never heard anyone know on the door or ring the bell. but when my phone was finally back on I got the message my order was cancelled and the money will not be refunded. I have to suffer and be robbed by uber eats because your delivery person is INCOMPETENT??? My phone rebooted on it's own so I have to be ROBBED AND PUNISHED for these things???  AFTER ALL THE YEARS OF LOYALTY TO UBER EATS...Just one mishap out of my control and I'M TREATED LIKE THIS.Wow..Other members of my family say that Deliveroo is not perfect but so much less stress than uber eats and ACTUALLY wonder why I still use uber eats.

"They will not refund my money. I ordered food from a restaurant and they did not deliver one of the items. The restaurant even wrote on the receipt sorry they ran out. I called the restaurant and they said i had to contact ubereats directly. I contacted ubereats on the same day i received the order to report the missing item. I was contacted by a rep to state a refund of ¬£2.40 had been processed however the item I paid for was ¬£8. I immediately messaged back snd stated the correct price and asked for confirmation that ¬£8 had been refunded, they responded with a generic ""your refund has been processed"" without confirming the amount.Lo and behold ¬£2.40 is refunded to my card so I go back to the supoort message to escalate, they respond and say they cant refund me as it is now passed 48hours and i shouldve reported the issue then. I confirmed that I did this and sent them screenshots of the conversations where i asked for confirmation of the correct amount etc.I then received a message from support saying they had reviewed my case and would receive a refund within 3 to 10 working days, its now been 3 weeks since.Ive contacted ubereats againg today to complain to receive the same BS response about 48 hours. I dont care whether its a small amount to me its the principle that you have not refunded me the money i paid for an item that was not received and was also confirmed by the restaurant that it wasnt sent.I feel robbed.

Within 5 minutes of schedule delivery, and 30 minutes after the food was supposed to be delivered from @CarsonsRibsChicago, the order was cancelled. Reason given: restaurant did not have what I ordered. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who said that was not true, there was no record of tonight's order in the system. Manager gave me UberEats number and I got the canned, ""sorry"" response. Meanwhile, it's Friday night with a hungry guest and I have no dinner. UberEats is terrible and I will no longer use.

"This is what I learned today from my first and last experience of ordering a delivery of McDonalds food via Uber Eat.1. The food will arrive cold or, at best, barely warm. You will need to reheat the fries in the oven, although apple pies will remain scaldingly hot for another 15 minutes.2. Some items will be missing.3 McDonalds will relieve themselves of all responsibility and ask you to phone Uber Eat.4. Uber Eat will tell you over the phone that you have to WRITE to them to get your missing milkshakes.5. You have to get cross with them before they will agree to put a ‚Äòpromotion‚Äô on your account which will enable you to reorder the items for free.6. The promotion will not work because their website says that it cannot process your order.7. When you call Uber Eat back to complain that the order won‚Äôt process, they will put you on hold for almost ten minutes before transferring you to a recorded message asking you if they have dealt with your query. When you select 2 for No, the line goes dead.8. When you call back to complain about the appalling level of customer service, they tell you to take a screenshot of the message that prevents you from reordering. They will then send you an email that you can reply to with your concerns about customer service, requests for a refund and an attached copy of the screenshot.9. When you try to follow the instructions given, you find that you cannot take a screenshot of the message because they have suddenly disabled your account!10. When you reply to their email with your complaint, sans the screenshot, they will reply to tell you that they can only deal with your complaint by telephone!11. You will feel so incensed that you want to leave a bad review on their website, but they don‚Äôt actually have any means of online feedback.12. You will feel so incensed that you go online and search for other people who have had similar experiences. You will find a lot of people on both sides of the pond who have had similar and worse experiences, including non-deliveries and assaults from drivers! Also, you will find cases of people being promised refunds for significant amounts, but never receive them.In short, my advice to you is this:  I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE UBER EAT, OR ANY BRAND RUN BY THE SAME COMPANYThe above has been my experience today and their attitude to customers is so poor and so rude that I feel compelled to do something I rarely do, on principle.

"Our foodcwas delivered virtually stone cold and we had items missing from order. It had taken the driver 36 minutes to travel what should have been barely a mile but route was convoluted due to doing other deliveries en route. The first items the driver brought to our door was a grocery order that was for someone else. It took him 5 minutes to go back to his car and swap the groceries for our order. Food delivered by Uber but ordered via McDonald's app. Although I ordered directly from the Mcdonald app, they won't do anything about it because it was delivered by Uber, I have to raise my complaint through Uber. I phoned Uber and they only accept calls for people with orders that haven't yet been delivered. Other than that, you need to raise the complaint on line. I downloaded their app but there is no option to raise the complaint as I didn't do my order through their app. So I went to the Uber site. I haven't used the Uber site to order food for at least 2 years and, to be able to raise a complaint, I have to input a code that they have sent to my old email account which I have no way of accessing. I have changed the email to my new email but, again, a code is sent to my old email before they will accept it. I will NEVER order a delivery via Uber again.

"I am an elderly lady, 77yrs. I sometimes get a bit befuddled, this was one of those times. Back in the day when you ordered Pizza you paid the driver. Well thats what I did to the Uber driver. The amount was $42.00 and he took the money praising me as he bowed all the way back to his car. It wasn't until the penny dropped for me, that I realized that Uber take the money from your bank account when you place the order. Thumbs down to that driver who did not even question me why I was paying him. Naughty Uber driver.

"Almost every time I order from McDonald's, there is at least one item missing or wrong.

When I brought this issue up, the only response I received was, ""We've looked into this for you and can see that you have already been refunded for this order.""

"I placed an order to a store that was closed. Apparently they informed Uber they wasn't taking orders, yet my order still went through. When the Uber drive arrived at the store he phoned me and told me it was closed. He then said that I need to cancel the order which I physically couldn't do. But he needed to complete the order to continue working. So I had to confirm delivery for the order because there was no way for me to cancel it. I then couldn't request a refund because I confirmed delivery, after finally being able to email them, they kept responding saying I'm not entitled to a refund. After emailing them many times that all they need to do is phone the store and the delivery guy who would both confirm the store was closed. After eventually drilling through to someone that I paid for a service which I never received, they turned around and eventually refunded me. However, they worded the email in such away to make it seem like I was in the wrong for example ""To make things right, I‚Äôve gone ahead and refunded you ¬£25.33 for the entire order as a goodwill gesture."", ""Please remember that this is a deviation from our normal policy under these circumstances, so I may not be able to offer the same outcome again in the future.""

"I strongly advise against using UberEats for food delivery. During my recent vacation in Amsterdam, I placed an order for 100 euros, but was dismayed to find that two items were missing, one valued at 25 euros and another at 4 euros.Upon discovering the issue, I promptly contacted UberEats to address the missing items. To my surprise, they only refunded the 4-euro item. Frustrated, I reached out again, specifically inquiring about the 25-euro item, to which they responded, ""We already refunded the missing items, and the matter has been resolved.""This experience left me utterly perplexed and dissatisfied with their service. Back in my home country, I typically use WOLT, despite its lower rating compared to UberEats. However, WOLT consistently provides excellent customer support, promptly addressing any missing items and ensuring customer satisfaction.It's disheartening to encounter such subpar service from a well-established organization like UberEats. Additionally, their app's interface leaves much to be desired in comparison to their competitors.Given the availability of alternative options, I strongly discourage using UberEats if you're seeking a reliable and responsive food delivery service.Update:They refunded the money now after some discussion, hence abit better rating","Date of experience: October 22, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,CH,Trust Pilot

"First time using this company and never again. Ordered through the mcdonald's app, said delivery was running late, fair enough, it's a weekend. When driver was finally on route it said he was 15 mins away, then 5, then it changed to delivered. Checked outside, no food. My daughter was literally waiting by the door. It was food for my 2 children as a treat. I tried ringing and texting the uber driver multiple times, but you can clearly tell it's not a proper number. It took ages to connect and always went to voicemail, the provider none of us have ever heard of. Rang mcdonald's, they couldnt do anything, rang uber, couldn't understand a word that was said from either of the 2 people I spoke to. Their accents are so thick and they speak so fast you literally can't make out a word they're saying.I've heard numerous stories of uber drivers making off with people's food, selling it on the side and making out they delivered it, but I never expected it to happen to me! It was a very rare treat, which I don't have the money to buy another mcdonald's for my very very dissapointed children!I really don't understand how these people get away with doing it? Shouldn't they be vetted or something before being hired?

"We have had multiple issues over this past year between being overcharged for quoted delivery fees, paying for priority delivery and then watching the driver go off-route into multiple neighborhoods even in opposite directions before coming to us (resulting in our order being 30min or more later than quoted & food cold), not being able to contact support & other difficulties with the app.   However, tonight sealed the deal.  We ordered from a restaurant that we order from almost weekly, and normally due to evening traffic it can take the delivery driver 30-60min to get to us once they‚Äôve picked up.  Never been an issue before.  Well, tonight.  Katelyn picked up our order and AFTER leaving the restaurant with our food, cancels it because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo far to drive‚Äù.  For 1) as an Uber Eats driver, you can see your entire route prior to accepting it.  So she should‚Äôve thought about that before accepting.  But 2) our bigger problem is that rather than returning the food to the restaurant to be given to another driver, she STOLE our food!  We had to as a result order again, the restaurant had to make it again, and we had to wait another hour+ for our food.   THEN!!!  The driver who picked up our second order attempt texts us after picking it up, complaining about the drive being 20miles (no traffic at this point) and wanting a bigger tip.   No!  You ACCEPTED this order knowing the distance!  And then on top of that, had 4 friends in the car‚Ä¶.one of the friends brought it to our door, not him‚Ä¶and they were all smoking weed that completely smelled up into our home & our food.  So to sum up.   Uber Eats let‚Äôs their drivers steal food & smoke weed & contaminate your food without consequence or compensation to us.  Never again will I use their service.","Date of experience: October 20, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Brandy Huckaby,Trust Pilot

"Uber email eats tempts you with discounts then adds extra fees so that it‚Äôs barely a discount. If the restaurant messes up as many often do, Uber always has same excuse that this order is not eligible for a refund. If their promotion malfunctions for some reason they will say your account is restricted due to refunds that you never got because they literally never do refunds. Their customer service reps are clueless most times and when they someone will contact you about your problem within 24 hours, what you can expect is a chat from a bot which usually has your situation completely wrong and then, when you try to explain yourself to them, they just keep repeating the same thing over and over.

"Customer service is honestly horrendous. I will not continue to use any of Uber's services for this reason. If there isn't good support, then I won't be a loyal customer. The lack of good customer service shows me that I, as a customer, am not valued. I find Uber's website isn't easy to find info, or to find their service terms and conditions.

"Sadly, Uber Eats customer service is abominable. Uber‚Äôs acquisition of Postmates made this worse. I placed an order through Postmates in March of 2023 (Order 9B99E). They delivered the wrong order, and I let Postmates know immediately, the same day. Postmates refunded / canceled the charge right away. Everything was taken care of quickly and easily.Four months later, in July of 2023, Uber charged my card for the same order. I contacted Uber support right away, and they said they charged my card again because the original charge didn‚Äôt go through. I let them know that the original charge was canceled by Postmates because the original delivered order was wrong. Uber support said that they could not do anything for me, as I contacted them outside of the 48 hour window. I explained to them that I contacted Postmates immediately, on the same day that the wrong order was delivered - That‚Äôs why Postmates refunded / canceled the original charge. Uber support kept reiterating that they could not do anything for me, as I contacted them outside of the 48 hour window.I went back and forth with Uber support for almost three months. Finally, someone from Uber priority support was able to credit my account for the charge in October of 2023. It absolutely should not have taken that long to rectify the situation. It almost seemed like Uber did not have access to the old Postmates records. In any case, it was some of the worst customer service that I‚Äôve ever received from any company.","Date of experience: July 20, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Jason,Trust Pilot

I have reported only two issues in the 5 years I have been soley an Unver Eats customer. I am no longer an Unber Eats customer as of today. Today I ordered from a local restaurant and the UberEats App responded that there was an error and my order had not been sent. I made a second identical order and waited for the food to be delivered. Upon delivery, the driver brought two of the same order. Upon checking the UberEats application I see I was charged for both orders and tipped the driver twice. I contacted UberEats and informed them of the issue. Despite my several attempts to explain that the error occurred only because information I received from their App they refused to reimburse me for even half of the order. UberEats just lost a very committed customer. I have not used or explored other food delivery apps but will move on after this experience.","Date of experience: October 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Desiree Demonbreun,Trust Pilot
"DO NOT USE I ordered and an item was missing. A pumpkin Spice Latte. It was the only reason I made the order but I added a few bits to make the order worthwhile. I don‚Äôt have a lot of money. I was made homeless after abuse and I was down. I wanted to treat myself So I tried to contact the driver first thinking he may have forgot the bag. I had two bags that had on them 1/3 and 2/3 suggesting there should be 3/3. He didn‚Äôt answer. So I went through the order connection thing to advise of missing item. After robot templates for 2 days where I just went round and round in circles, being told no refund will be allowed in this case and then going round in circles again, I finally got a human response. Yet they still wouldn‚Äôt give me a refund for ¬£3. You may think let it go it‚Äôs only ¬£3. But that‚Äôs a lot to someone recovering from losing everything. And I actually paid over ¬£20 in the end for this order as I bought some extra bits. I was down and wanted a treat. They knew this as I advised them of it. I‚Äôm also going through an investigation for CA and so I needed a little bit of joy. (They also knew this in the end because I basically broke down verbally)For a huge company to be so petty to not give a very down woman ¬£3 or whatever the coffee was, is actually disgraceful. I did all they asked. Contacted driver. Provided pics of the bags I had. But how do you take a pic of a non item. A missing item? It‚Äôs almost accusing me of lying. I won‚Äôt ever use them again. There‚Äôs no heart or compassion. They should be seriously ashamed of their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù.","Date of experience: October 15, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Cj,Trust Pilot

"Company marks up prices of items to cover their 30% cut, often there are significant problems with orders that aren't properly addressed or even rectified, it is not worth ordering even with the 40% off promos because the 40% will only cover the taxes by the end of the minimum fee and you will most likely receive inedible or mishandled food/products in return, even when you do manage to get your order rectified and in some cases refunded, they usually don't even consider how much it impacted your experience(ex. You pay 24$+tip after charges for a subway meal but only the Sub was wrong etc, you will receive a computers determination of the original Sub price refunded before any charges, tips or anything. Which will most likely look something like 9.50$ for your 6-inch Sub. Leaving you out 15$+tip for some chips/cookies and a 500ml drink.) As close as you can come to highway robbery in consumers terms, highly recommend any other app as even food that is ready to be picked up will sit there while the driver is just outside on his phone(illegal while driving btw but what else are you supposed to do all day, your job?) or smoking in/just outside his car, rarely will they ever have proper food delivery bags anymore as uber can't exactly enforce it(or they choose not to) and your food is often just thrown somewhere in their car(a lot of the times on the floor because they take multiple orders and cram em all in there, which i want to state a lot of these orders would even be claimed by multiple accounts etc so a lot of the time your driver would drive right past you delivering your order just to drive across and deliver to a completely different address he had picked an order up for from a completely different restaurant in a different account, upon pointing this out tp Uber in their earlier stages, the support team with their tools would just say 'yea, sorry. We've helped direct the driver, he'll be there soon' as if he was lost or something and now your food is on the other side of the city in someones car dying(food literally dies it's the whole point of efficient service and standards) they don't care though because the restaurant usually gets stuck with the bill(thanks uber, really helping out small businesses with all the money you made during the pandemic and that 30% cut you take from them). People really don't realize how bad this is for restaurants and how it impacts the market(things we consume etc)","Date of experience: October 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,White Noise Z-White_Noise-Z,Trust Pilot

"I‚Äôve been a customer of uber eats for awhile now. The beginning was great, pandemic times. They had their A game. Now- Zero stars if I could leave that. They give me a weekly code of 5 orders worth $40 spent for 40% off. That is a weekly basis promo. I barely order due to their customer service. I don‚Äôt use up all those 40% on a weekly basis. My August & September order is totalling to 1 each month and 2 in October. Uber is our last resort if Door dash isn‚Äôt available. I feel like Door dash is well managed than Uber. Anyways, I called today and was told the there was a breach, and I asked how was it breached? He said that the promo code was uber used or over used, then why send it to customers then? It‚Äôs on the fine print, sure! But why bother send it out if you will take it back? Uber eats doesn‚Äôt know how to look after their customers.

"UPDATE: UberEats now refusing to refund this order saying the driver tried contacting me. I have checked my details are correct - they are, and also can show no missed calls, and door cam footage of my husband waiting outside to receive a delivery that never arrived to our address. COMPLAINTI placed an order with a local restaurant this evening and the delivery address was incorrect (it had defaulted to the restaurant's address for delivery which should have been clear to any one that it was incorrect!) I was unable to change the address by either talking to the restaurant or attempting to contact one of the 3 different drivers who showed up on the app; when I was finally confirmed a driver, I sent him a text message as he never picked up his phone; it kept going to voicemail. Driver never contacted me despite me leaving 2 voice mail messages and a text (he replied to a text to say he was going to deliver to the address I sent him, he did not); I now have a message saying it was delivered - however it has not been delivered. Also, it is impossible to get a hold of a live rep; I had to call the restaurant support line to eventually get connected to a rep, with whom I was on hold for 15mins and then he hung up - he had all my details yet never reached out to me to ensure my issue was taken care of. That is an extremely poor customer experience.How this situation was never resolved despite me trying to get in touch with Uber Eat's customer service, who then cut me off when I was trying to resolve it on the phone, or following the steps on the app. Fortunately the restaurant is amazing, and when we called them, they rushed an order through which we ended up picking up - a hassle we were trying to avoid as we're both unwell. Turns out, even the restaurant has issues with Uber and will be stopping working with them.","Date of experience: October 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JM,Trust Pilot

"This is a review after months of being an UberOne member, and being frustrated not once, twice, or three times. But every other order I've had over the last few months. I consistently am unable to communicate with my driver. I leave extremely clear delivery instructions, and for the drivers who speak my language, it goes off great. For those (every other) who do not, I end up needing to cancel my order completely. Every time I call them (as directed by uber eats) they will pick up and say ""No english sorry."" I live in a big city apartment and there are directions necessary to find me. I don't order uber eats to spend an hour trying to find my food, and to be completely unable to communicate with my drivers is unacceptable. Please provide your drivers an AI tool that can translate directions. Otherwise, it's a service I have stopped using.Additionally, every time I reach out to suport about these issues I get snippy responses such as ""I suggest you reach out to your driver"" which I do try to call and unfortunately I don't speak a second language.

My latest experience was terrible. I was told by the driver if I ask him, he will bring my food to me. He only missed off pretty please. He kept talking over me and wouldn't listen that I couldn't walk. He eventually brought my food to me and saw I was disabled. He said some people say they're disabled just to get the food delivered to their door! He also said Uber only give them so much time to deliver. It would only have taken a few minutes to get to my flat in a lift. I have complained to Uber and they keep asking me for more details.

"I ordered for the first time yesterday as we were at work and had very little time to sort something to eat, I ordered through the mcdonald's website and it's told that the delivery would be in 15 minutes. The front door was wide open and we were moving things around the front door so was never out of earshot. It gets to 25 minutes and we are wondering whether delivery is so I go back to the website and it said it's been delivered, I try to find some information on it and I can't find anything that tells me where my order is, so I try speaking to the virtual assistant chat bot, which was absolutely useless. It did not understand what I was trying to say and rather than putting me through to somebody that would help it just kept putting me back to the beginning. I find a number for uber eats who apparently deliver this, I called expecting to just either get told where my delivery was, that there was some kind of mix up or get a redelivery. I call and I'm left on hold a number of times and I'm getting frustrated because the whole idea of this was that it was the save time, I explained to the person on the phone that I can't just be waiting on the phone, they did not offer to call me back they just kept me on hold. When they finally came back to me they told me that they were enabled to give me a redelivery or a refund, when I questioned this they said that they had proof of delivery. When I asked what proof of delivery they did not answer me initially, but later on they explained that they apparently had a photo, but they would not describe this photo at all. They also said that the driver had tried to contact me twice but I had not received any calls.I asked him to send this proof of delivery and they have said that they are not able to, and that I have to take it back to the mcdonald's chat bot.Feeling very frustrated I walked the length and breadth of the industrial estate I work on, to see if anybody else had taken delivery. No other places on the road were open apart from a self-storage place.My phone the local mcdonald's that would have delivered this and they told me that uber eats are the people that should be dealing with this, yet we ordered through the mcdonald's website so our ""contract"" is with mcdonalds, placing me in a position of perpetual run around.Something that was supposed to be saving us time had me messing around for over an hour with no resolution.Absolutely do not recommend, I feel that I've been had by crooks, and I do not expect to be in this position when ordering from a company like mcdonald's.

"The shopper was great. She kept in touch when items weren‚Äôt available. It was a great experience.  Then, I saw the charge and noticed that the promo my daughter-in-law had given me was not deducted from the balance, and I called their customer service, which was not easy to find a number in the first place. It just went downhill from there now I have about $200 worth of charges on two different credit cards that I had in my wallet and four out of six people that I‚Äôve spoken to you were extremely rude.  I was hung up on twice trying to speak to the supervisor. I finally got one supervisor who I thought was great and he fixed everything. 10 days later I‚Äôm looking at those two credit cards and the charges are all back, including the credit he had given me and the charges were on a second credit card. I called back had a fairly difficult time getting a supervisor, but not as hard as the first time. Then I got a supervisor by the name of Gabriella, who talked like a robot and repeated the same thing over and over and was no help at all. She ended up hanging up on me.  I called back. Ask for another supervisor was told I‚Äôd be called back in an hour and if they were busy, never received a call two hours later I called back again and spoke to another representative. Asked to have a supervisor call me and was told it would be five minutes and they would call me. I never received a call back. I will never ever use Uber eats again or any of their services for that matter and neither will anybody I know because everybody will hear the story.

So the uber driver went to the wrong property proceeded to take picture of food outside and then picked it back up and drove away with order. Have been to the address where picture was taken no car on drive and curtains drawn so no one at home. So delivery driver stole the food and uber refuse to refund money.

"Uber Eats is fine to use if you never expect to have problems with your orders---ever. However, the moment you have a problem with your order, you can expect no help from them. Trying to contact customer support is so difficult, I can only assume it was designed to be difficult. Once you reach customer support, their willingness to help you rivals the willingness of an insurance company required to pay out claims. They'll do anything to avoid actually helping you. Of course, this really isn't much different from any other food delivery service. Every order, you basically have to hope nothing goes wrong.

"What DREADFUL & AWFUL customer services this 'company' has!Ordered my food via mcdelivery which runs through uber eats - delivery driver/rider NEVER arrived at the given address, neither did she attempt to call me, instead she only text me...when I tried calling her and it went straight to voicemail...so I'm responding to her texts after she says she can't find the address...yet according to the delivery tracking map she was sat 2 minutes away on a completely different street!!I even went outside to look for her, she's nowhere to be seen, she then clicks a button that claims my food has been delivered instead of cancelling it...which would've automatically started the refund process...soI call uber eats customer services the first time, to seek some advice, the bloke told me to contact the McDonald's restaurant in question whom then told me to contact uber again so I did, explained the whole entire situation again and this time they were very very hostile...I was met with, ""Your delivery driver followed the guidelines and tried to contact you several times"" when I questioned how she tried to contact me the customer advisor couldn't confirm she tried to call me...and my phone call history will prove I never received a single attempted phonecall...only text messages :(And he refused to refund me the money I've lost which is in my opinion is absolutely awful.I sit here hungry & out of pocket because of a delivery drivers/riders navigational mess up.","Date of experience: October 12, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MR,Trust Pilot

"Complete and utter cluster. As an individual and as a family, we do meal delivery services on the regular. In fact, I work as a physician at a nearby hospital, small community, no more than 4,000 in the community and all restaurants within 5 minute of small community hospital. Never, not one single time, have we had any issue with either DoorDash or Grubhub or even delivery from independent local establishments.Working as a physician, along with all the night staff, I have crazy 12-hour shifts, typically 7p-7a. That means, upon arrival, myself and my nurses need to sort out meal plans early or the clock will beat us and we will run out of options. Thought I would give Uber Eats a try, for the sake of completeness and to give everyone a trial comparison.Big, big, HUGE mistake. Where to even begin. Place an order for the local Steak 'n Shake and execute the tracker so I can follow progress. It is about 8:15 pm at the time. Up comes the tracker and after only a very brief time shows my driver is at the restaurant picking up the order. This status remains unchanged for the better part of 30 minutes. Finally, as we push 45-60 minutes, the tracker reads ""Oops, finding another driver"". This is after 45-60 minutes and now we don't even have a driver?!After about 30 minutes of ""Oops"" persisting, the net result of this is very obvious, Uber doesn't have a driver available in this area, we are at one hour, clearly not going to make it before the ""absolute latest"" time, and my options are dwindling. Total time greater than one hour, ""Oops no driver"" time greater than 30 minutes. It was abundantly clear that the food was not going to be delivered in time, let alone probably not at all.I contact agents via the Uber Eats online chat and try to relate this and the urgency in resolving the issue so I can move on and still look at dining options for the night. All I got was a bunch of canned ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"" and reading from prepared scripts. I was still about 15 minutes out from the drop-dead time, but it was completely clear where we were headed for this and, if we get this resolved now, I can place another order with another delivery service, my only chance for eating anything other than a Crustable from the vending machine.Still...canned responses, scripts, etc. The suggestion was that ""the food is technically not late until 9:15 pm and it is already prepared, so we cannot refund unless it is after 9:15"". The thing is, it only would take about two minutes to realize that no delivery in > 1 hour and persistent ""Oops, finding another driver"" means that it just isn't going to happen, quite clearly at this point, so do me a favor and consider and a half to be late enough to give me time to still find something.Even the suggestion that a burger, fries, and shake made over an hour earlier would still be edible is pretty absurd. It is quite clear, Uber didn't have a driver anywhere near this small town and left me hanging for about an hour and a half while I was the only one apparently smart enough to figure that. When 9:15 did roll around, the status still read ""Oops, finding another driver"". No meal tonight, on the damned computer much of the first two hours of work, and the complete failure of customer service to make any effort to actually understand the problem and address the problem.Took me exactly two times to realize that Uber Eats either lacks the footprint or business plan to successfully practice this model. Among the most abysmal customer service experiences I have encountered for some time.","Date of experience: October 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Steve Perkins,Trust Pilot

"They do not believe in following FDA Food Safety Guidelines as outlined by United States Law. When my food has sat out for over 2 hours, they refuse a refund even though it is not food safe and could send a person to the hospital. If you want to have safe food, you have to pay a premium price. This should be illegal - you are charging customers extra should you ""not want Uber to break the law"" and send your family to the hospital with food poisoning. It is not the restaurants' fault - the fault lies solely with this negligent company. I am reporting them to the FDA and encourage everyone to do so. In case you've never worked in the Food Service Industry - any meat or dairy product that has sat out at temperatures over 40 degrees for over 1 hour is considered dangerous and not food safe. Food poisoning bacteria begin to grow on the food after this time and at these temperatures. They also lie and tell me that their drivers always use heating/warming bags, but never once in about 60+ orders has an UberEats driver used such a bag to keep the food hot. This website asked me for ""date of experience"" but this is a recurring problem and the Customer Service Agents refuse to address the illegalities of their practices or refund money for unsafe food. I have had multiple orders be picked up and driven around town for literally over 2 hours, to arrive ice cold and unsafe. Their answer is to ""show a photo"" then say it looks ""good"". That is not how Food Safety Inspections are done, by photo. The 'food safety clock' starts ticking the moment the potentially hazardous (if improperly handled) foods have left the refrigerator, not the store, as well. Every restaurant adheres to this or gets shut down when proper food regulations are in place. Uber doesn't care and they will NOT refund you in the case of food safety issues. When orders are wrong, the refunds are only for a portion of the missing items, as well. I had a missing order that never arrived a week ago - I did get a refund but they let the driver who kept my food keep the large tip I had left when placing the order, too. Never again. Call your local government about these practices and the FDA if you have also been wronged by this company. I am just glad that I have not gotten sick because I know when to toss it out, even if they just robbed me for $50 or more.","Date of experience: October 08, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,EL,Trust Pilot

"I have not ordered from UberEATS in a while but decided to try it out again after receiving a 50% off promotion.

The 50% promotion was for a maximum value of $15, and this entire amount went to delivery and other fees.Again, this was almost expected. The reason I am giving my recent experience a 1-star review is because the delivery driver arrived more than 30-40 minutes later than the initial expected delivery time. In addition, the delivery driver's car that was displayed on the app was not the car that was actually driven to make the delivery. The restaurant also did not adhere to some of the special requests.

Promo didn't apply for my order so I wanted to cancel my order and  I reached the help desk. They mentioned they cannot do anything on ongoing order and asked me to wait until it completes. My order was delayed and I reached the help desk . Several drivers assigned and cancelled later I came to know that the merchant cancelled my order I waited one hour throughout to learn that my order was not placed and Uber app kept me waiting almost and hour and wasted three drivers trip and poor communication overall . I ended up starving . Luckily there was a marry brown open on a Sunday night that fed me . My second order on Uber app went through . My first order was not a great experience at all .

"First, a store appeared for delivery to my address, only at checkout to show it was too far away. More importantly, I was charged approximately double what I originally paid for all the items I did receive. I was told that the ‚Äúestimated total‚Äù memorandum was supposed to account for discrepancies between price and store, when if you read the actual message in the app, it shows it‚Äôs for adjustments in weighted items and replacement items requested, nothing about major changes in prices being charged for exact items ordered. I have repeatedly asked the company for an itemized accounting of the cost paid per item, and have not received a response. From what I can calculate without an itemized list of what I actually paid, I was charged $90 for what I committed to paying $45 for in groceries. Another difficulty in calculating the exact difference was the fact the store was out of stock on 12 items ordered and still my total bill went from $80 up to $90 with me receiving 12 fewer items. Apparently, Uber Eats is just fine with bait and switching a low-income family for double the price on our already small grocery budget.

"Part of the delivery decline. This service and all the other app based services are failing, at least in certain places. They take over an hour to deliver their food, leaving it stone cold. The customer service is nonexistent and the app owners themselves are determined to push responsibility onto restaurants and drivers.

"Unfortunately I have to rate them one star ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a while since I ordered there but they were there only once with the restaurant I like! When ordering I choose standard delivery and rather gave the driver a tip which was probably a mistake?! Essentially, it took over an hour to get my food (I could see on the app that the food was sitting at the restaurant for almost an hour before it was picked up). I tried contacting the driver who was just driving around and customer service how told me that it should be with me soon ‚Äî what is even more frustrating is that you can see the driver in real time not picking up your order! When the driver finally picked up my order and even so he was already super late had to still make several stops on the way (again very frustrating because you thing you finally get your food only for him to drive one wrongs direction again). My food arrived 20 min after the latest estimated arrival and of course was melted/ cold so I complained again (a very long process unlike deliveroo, where you get a refund right away), they had to write and email and in the end I only go a particular refund even so my whole meal was ruined!So because I didn‚Äôt pay ¬£3 extra for speedy delivery I had to wait over an hour got cold/ melted food and only got a partial refund‚Äî thank you but never again!

"I placed an order for a local restaurant to be picked up.  After ordering I discovered Uber switched the location of the restaurant to one 20 minutes away from my home, instead of the franchise 2 minutes away.  They do this for deliveries so they can get more mileage, and thus charge more, but I do not want to drive 40 minutes round trip to pick up a hamburger.  I tried to immediately cancel, but by the time the chat agent responded I was told the order was accepted by the vendor and could no longer be canceled.

Unfortunately my experience with Uber Eats was my first experience and definitely might be my last to place an order and to cancel it and then to know that even though I didn't get the food that the restaurant will then turn around and take the money and charge me an additional $15 so if my order was $42 I got charged with $57 for order I did not even get the food I think UBER EATS CAN HANDLE THIS DIFFERENTLY,"Date of experience: September 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AR,Trust Pilot

"It used to be 4-5 stars. I've been with them since the beginning. They have increasingly gotten worse. Their time estimates are basically bait and switch. They'll give a short estimate to encourage you to order. Then in tiny subscript there will be a second ""delivered latest by"" time after you put the order in that puts a second estimate 20-40 min after your initial time estimate range. Now every 3rd order, I'm getting deliveries that actually deliver 20-30 min past this ""latest by"" time, getting close to 2 hrs sometimes. Then to add insult to injury, they put your account on review if you complain too much, because their broken system encourages inaccurate delivery estimates, and regularly breaks them. Basically they bait and switch you to order, then deliver in 2-3x the time estimate and give a pittance for compensation.

He/she did neither and spoke down to me as if I am a child about how they 'understand it must be frustrating' blah blah blah, did not resolve my issue, ended the chat while I was still typing and when I reconnected, asked how they could help me FURTHER? When they have not helped me at all.

So I lost my money 70 pounds and the driver ended up with the food for free ?????? now saying the supermarket doesn‚Äôt accept returns, it makes you wonder why the driver is so keen to say no one was home so they can get the food for free, because the supermarket won‚Äôt accept food back because of non delivery This company won‚Äôt say what happens to the food (that supposedly was undeliverable ?

"We ordered grocery from Waitrose on 25 September (20EAD was the order number) and waited over an hour for the delivery to arrive. Whilst checking the delivery person through Uber Eats app, we saw that he stopped nearby our house and marked the order as ""delivered"". We were waiting for him door open but noone came. We immediately tried to call him but he didn't pick up. I also tried calling him from my mobile as well for more than 20 times and he didn't reply. After explaining the situation to Uber Eats, they wrote back saying that the delivery person was outside our house for more than 7 minutes, hence we were not eligible for a refund. In total, we waited more than 1 hour for the delivery which was not delivered at all.This makes no sense as the Uber Eats app asks for a code which we need to provide to the delivery person. And how come the delivery can be marked as ""delivered"" without obtaining the code from us. And it is not acceptable for Uber Eats to believe the delivery person without any proof of delivery.Very disappointing experience with Uber Eats. Such a shame.The next day we went to local Waitrose store to explain and they agreed to give us the fruit and vegetables from our order for free(excluding a milk, yogurt and bread, which is also weird).","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AD,Trust Pilot

"Uber have the great service among all the other rides so far but the only thing that they should fix now is that, as passengers we get excited when we get those promotions that we normally get from Uber and we will use the app more often when there‚Äôs these promotions of which is good but the problem we are facing are with the drivers, Uber drivers don‚Äôt like to pick us up when we use our promotions and if they did accept the promotional ride they will first call the passenger and ask how much is the ride or the promotion and once you tell them they will cancel the ride and that is annoying and frustrating.

"Horrible experience when I made a delivery order through McDonald's app. The driver was very rude and went to another estate. He called twice but he wasn't engaged in the call as I later on found out that they need to make two calls to follow the policy so he won't be blamed. However, he was planning on not delivering the food as he wasn't listening to instructions for the address. Looking at the map he was in the same location not trying to find our address and waiting for the time to finish so he can take the food. We never received our food eventually and felt so gutted. Lots of phone calls to uber customer service however no outcome. On the other hand, McDonald's were very helpful and gave us vouchers as a courtesy.","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SA,Trust Pilot

"It took me awhile to find where I can leave a review but was motivated as I am feeling quite let down by Kings Roast on Lunn Ave. Being a Monday other establishments are closed so had little option to support Kings Roast Lunn Ave. Not only are their prices exorbitant e.g. almost $17 for a small lamb dinner they make you feel they just want your money and get out along with a 3 per cent credit card surcharge. In English I could not understand I was snapped at on arrival when I asked the young lady a question. She later went on to over charge me as she had the wrong order which I can accept but there was no apology.

"I recently used Uber Eats in the UK, and here's my honest review. While it's known for its speed, there's a catch ‚Äì you have to pay an additional fee to get your delivery first. It's quick, but only if you're willing to cough up more money.On a personal note, I've been using Uber Eats since it first launched in the UK, and I've noticed some significant changes. Unfortunately, most of these changes have made it less appealing. The platform now charges restaurants over 30% of their sales, which likely leads to an increase in menu prices. On top of that, there are additional fees for delivery, and if you want your food to arrive faster, you guessed it ‚Äì another fee.The ""discounts"" they offer are often limited to certain struggling restaurants, which doesn't really benefit the average customer. Due to all these fees and increased food prices, I've made the decision to stop using Uber Eats. It's simply become too expensive for what it offers.My advice? Consider alternatives or grab something on your way home ‚Äì it's usually cheaper, more convenient, and fresher.","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,RE,Trust Pilot

"Horrible customer service. I had a driver who refused to come at the main entrance of my building and call the bell, he texted me in the app he has arrived and demanded me to come out and get the food. When is I told him I couldn‚Äôt come out he left and took the food with him. That‚Äôs not the main problem though, the problem is the horrible customer service which is also hard to reach. I texted them the situation and they said the driver was waiting already 7 minutes. Then I asked them why he didn‚Äôt follow the instructions already setup as a previous driver. They told me a million times he couldn‚Äôt  reach me and I explained to them a million times he did through the app and I did reply. I asked him to come to the building entrance and he declined and they continued telling me that my order is not eligible for refund because he was waiting 7 minutes. Like no solid reasoning and response to the actual facts whatsoever. I ended up being more pissed off at the customer experience rather than the driver. They could have just justified the driver, he could  have even been in a bad day, cool, but what do you do though as a customer service? You respond like an intelligent human at least according to what the customer is saying and resolve the issue in a way instead of repeating a script gaslighting the customer because you didn‚Äôt bother to read what was reported. Like never again. App deleted. I won‚Äôt be hungry because of that Uber. At the end of the day, Uber is not an essential service.I would suggest others to follow the same.

"Taking money for services not provided!!! You ruined a family birthday meal by cancelling an order and charging for it!! Your customer services are so awful that I‚Äôm genuinely wondering how you‚Äôre even allowed to operate or if you have many customers left.

Your social media and in-app assistants are useless and either ignore or give crap responses thanking me for my understanding?! I have reported the company to my bank.

However after a while they started doing multi drops and I ended up getting my meals cold. But, the worse was to come the drivers started just not delivering at all. On one occasion the driver came to my door and then just drove away I took picture of his number plate on his moped for proof, then on the last occastion the delivery the driver simply delivered it to the wrong adress in wrong area. When i called to tell him he said he would contact uber to get my refund but I dought he did. I called CS at uber-eats on two occastions to report non deliverys and they say the money takes 10 days to go back into my bank - Been 30 days, so far no money has been returned now I am down 50 pounds with nothing to show for it.

"This company is so unspeakably dog feaces that I have had to change this numerous times, so I will adjust this for brevity so it can maybe be of some use to anyone who stumbles across it.Before I try to briefly break down the steps I have experienced, here is the takeaway, this company is so bad that they stopped monitoring their complaints email address, removed a complaints section from their website and they have trained ( for lack of a better word) their staff to hangup/disconnect the live chat if you ask about a complaint procedure which literally violates governmental regulations put in place to ensure minimum standards for post-sales support 1: I attempted to place a small order using guest check out as I did not have an account2: I got to the check out stage, approved the payment via my bank app, for some reason uber declined the transaction on their end.3: I tried again, benefit of the doubt, figured maybe it was a one off website hiccup, this time I get a message saying I am not allowed to place the order as my card is associated with another account, a blatant lie, the first of many4: I went to the wrongly titled ""help"" section where it turns out all they do is tell you to create an account, an account is mandatory to even be allowed to try and talk to anyone5: I bite the bullet and create an account6: I talk to ""support"" staff who say "" I can see that your concern is not related to this account. Kindly write to us from the concerned account"", absolute lobtomites. You create an account to talk to them and they tell you they can't talk to you about that account. Genius training the ""support"" workers get clearly7: When you try to explain what your problem is about, that you do not have another account they say ""I am directing you towards the relevant team and they will be addressing your concern accordingly"". What this actually means is, ""I am too stupid, with too little training to be of any use whatsoever so I am disconnecting the chat now""8: Given the above I have tried to file a complaint which is impossible. The only email address I could find generates an automated reply saying it is unmonitored, there are no details on their website on how to file a complaint, the phone numbers floating around are evidently also unmanned.It's a joke. More expensive than any other service of its kind, more fee's than any other service of its kind, worst support literally ever to have existed, I could go and visit a comatose patient and there would be more brain activity and I would be more likely to get help than wading through the idiocy that is the entirety of ubereats ""support""","Date of experience: September 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,J.,Trust Pilot

"Terrible Experience: Never Using Uber Eats Again!Order Number: #3C953Order Date: 23/07/2023I had an absolutely horrendous experience with Uber Eats, and I feel compelled to share my frustration and disappointment. I placed an order worth ¬£28.18 on the aforementioned date, and to my utter disbelief, the meal was never delivered. It was a complete letdown, and I'm still in disbelief that such a reputable service could fail so miserably.Upon realizing that my order was missing, I immediately contacted Uber Eats to report the issue and request a refund. Little did I know that this would be the start of a long and frustrating journey. Despite raising a formal complaint and providing all the necessary details, my money was never refunded as requested. It's incredibly disheartening to be left out of pocket after a service failure that was entirely out of my control.To add insult to injury, the food was delivered to a completely different address than my own. Not only did Uber Eats fail to deliver the meal I paid for, but they also managed to deliver it to the wrong location entirely. This level of incompetence is beyond comprehension, especially considering that accurate address information was provided during the ordering process.The most disappointing aspect of this entire ordeal has been Uber Eats' abysmal customer service. Their complaint service is an absolute joke. It's truly disheartening to see a company with such potential fall so short in terms of addressing customer issues. My attempts to communicate with their support team were met with indifference, delays, and ultimately, no resolution.After this appalling experience, I can confidently say that I will never use Uber Eats again. The poor service, coupled with the complete lack of accountability and support, has left me feeling frustrated, cheated, and deeply dissatisfied. I urge anyone considering using Uber Eats to think twice and explore alternative food delivery services that prioritize their customers' satisfaction and take responsibility for their failures.In conclusion, my experience with Uber Eats has been nothing short of a nightmare. From the undelivered meal to the incorrect delivery address and their woeful complaint service, every aspect of their service has been a disappointing failure. Save yourself the trouble and avoid Uber Eats at all costs.","Date of experience: July 23, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ropafadzo Mshayavanhu,Trust Pilot

"Ordered through ubereats. The restaurant dispatched the order. The delivery driver never delivered any food. Was then marked complete.The kicker?

While I have proof to show, they are not willing to show they have proof.Do NOT order through Uber eats.

"(Added to McDonalds as well.)McDonalds have ‚Äúpartnered‚Äù with Uber Eats to deliver food.

McDonalds have also refused a refund or to acknowledge fault. They don‚Äôt have access to Ubereats‚Äôs transactions.I have reached out to CAB over this. It may seem like a small amount to get upset about, but the point is that two days in a row I have been forced to bin all the food, as no means to reheat, and will not be compensated with my money back.

"Do NOT use Ubereats unless you have an entire evening to throw away being frustrated and hungry. They‚Äôll reschedule your delivery numerous times, they won‚Äôt allow you to cancel it when that happens so you can‚Äôt make a new order, but they‚Äôll allow a driver to cancel it after you‚Äôve spent 2.5 hours of waiting. Original delivery time of 8:10. At 8:00, that changed to 9:20pm. The original LATEST delivery estimate was 8:55, and every customer service agent refused to look into the matter until that time and I was essentially told to get lost until then. All while the app says it won‚Äôt be arriving until 9:20 anyway. Then I noticed the driver was reassigned a second time. At 9pm, I tried to reach out to customer service, where my order was suddenly cancelled without any input from me. They said somebody else had picked up the order. I‚Äôm absolutely sure it was one of the other drivers who picked it up and then disappeared off the map. They‚Äôll let a driver pick something up, then they‚Äôll reassign the order (!!!???), and no communication will happen between the two drivers or the restaurant about who picked up the food and where it went. I was willing to wait 2 hours for cold soggy food but that was the final straw. Because they cancelled and refunded the order, I was again essentially told to get lost by customer service. Not one person considered this situation to be a real problem or an inconvenience. They don‚Äôt give a SPLIT sh!t about the customer experience. This service takes orders they KNOW they can‚Äôt fulfil all in an attempt to grab as much money as they can.

They decided to just sit there (they where a mile away from restaurant) and when they decided to move they took forever to get there and I'm guess by the time they got there the food was freezing!Took 4 minutes for them to drive from the restaurant to my house. So I highly doubt the food turned stone cold in 4 minutes. After they delivered the food the driver purposely left the delivery open as if to say it was still being delivered so it looked like he delivered it within the time frame. WHICH HE DID NOT.

"I ordered a delivery through the McDonalds app and UberEats were responsible for delivering it.  They didn't deliver it and they refused to give me a refund.  McDonalds are adamant that UberEats are responsible for refunding but they will not entertain it.  They refused to contact the driver to see where he'd delivered it, the driver wouldn't answer the phone when I tried calling them, they had a photo of a doorstep where the food was left but wouldn't provide the photo to me and wouldn't allow me to send them a photo of my doorstep for comparison.  They also advised that they have no complaints department so I can't take it any further.  Absolute joke of a company.  Avoid at all costs.

What‚Äôs the purpose of putting delivery instructions in your profile if they are not going to respect them. I clearly have please meet me at the door and hand me the food.  In addition to my food I ordered an orange Fanta as well.  Well the app said the driver is 1 min away. Well it said that for 5 mins.  I just happen to go to the door to look out to see if they were out there and I saw my food sitting on the ground with ants around the bag.  And the orange Fanta was clear‚Ä¶go figure.  So I picked everything up and came in the house. The beve to waste on my hand and it tasted like seltzer water.  The only thing I could eat was the wings because they were in a covered box everything else was in the little open boat containers and I don‚Äôt know if anything crawled in them.  I tried calling the driver and it went to voicemail. So I contacted customer service through chat.  They gave me a 4-5 paragraph apology and a $2 credit.  Well the beverage it‚Äôs self was $3.39.  So I texted back and inquired what was the $2 for when the beverage was $3.39 their response was we‚Äôve credited your account with $2 is anything else we can help you with.  So needless to say I will go back to DOORDASH!!!   I will not be using Uber Eats again. They can take those $2 and give them to someone else!,"Date of experience: September 20, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wanda Jones,Trust Pilot

"Terrible customer service & delivery service.I ordered food to my office when I was working late, something I have done countless times. As I see the driver approach I go to stand outside the building and wait. I get a notification that the driver has arrived but I see from the map that he is more than 1 street over. I receive a call where the driver was talking to me but I could not understand anything (unfortunately he had a thick accent and his english wasn't very good - not the driver's fault but made communication difficult). Therefore I told him to switch to chat, where I typed instructions as to how to reach my office, even giving the store in front as reference. No reply. Tried to call the driver. No reply. Eventually receive a notification that the driver had delivered my food with a picture of my delivery left in the streets of London! Nowhere near original location.I have a picture of where he left the food (on the London pavement next to what looks like an iron gate to I don't know where - clearly not an office or a private address) and the map location, which is miles off delivery address. Despite this, they would not refund me the order. I am out 20 pounds with no food to show for it. Awful service.

"Uber eats had a 50% off fruit and veg on Mondays promotion. When I tried to use it, it wasn't available, I thought maybe it's because I've used this promo before. So, I asked my partner to look, it wasn't on his either, but, there was a ¬£15 discount voucher available for him to use. We clicked on that and looked at the available stores, we selected our store and ordered our shop. The discount was applied and the total was ¬£23.49. Uber Eats however, after the transaction, has decided he couldn't use that discount on that transaction, so, they have taken ¬£38.49 from his bank account. We would not have ordered those items paying that price but the voucher cancelled out the over priced items and the fees so ¬£23.49 was acceptable. We contacted UE straight away and they initially said it was just a pending amount and not the actual amount that would be taken. Then when it has actually cleared from the bank and we contacted them again, they have said that discount wasn't applicable on that transaction so tough. How can anybody ever trust a discount code with them ever again if they can just change their mind after the event?","Date of experience: September 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,LD,Trust Pilot

"The website crashed 3 times when I was processing my order to be delivered between 19:45 and 20:15 so I had to download the app on my phone, by the time I did it pushed back the order to between 20:00 and 20:30 with an estimate of 20:05 delivery time, I ordered approximately 19:15 so that would be a delivery time of 50 minutes. Instead it took 1 hour and 50 minutes, arriving at 20:55pm. Because it was so late I had already given up on it, I presumed it wasn‚Äôt coming. I made and ate some toast and went to bed. I was in bed when it arrived (my Sunday started at 3:55am so it was late for me) so the delivery driver got me up out of bed. The food was cold. I didn‚Äôt eat it. What can I do with a cold kebab that took 1 hour and 55 minutes to arrive by which time I‚Äôd brushed my teeth and gone to bed?

"If I could give no stars I would. I have had nearly ¬£28.34 stolen. My partner discriminated on the telephone and refused to put me through to a manager. I ordered mcdonalds which arrived stone cold and missing an item. As a result I go to restaurant to sort it out despite paying delivery. Restaurant really helpful and inform me to complain to uber for a full refund.At this point I re order and pay for it. Return home, contact uber who quickly inform me that due to the driver collecting it and delivering it ""in time"" that I have to accept this fact but they will refund me ¬£2.36 for the missing burger. I then speak with a manager, mentioning firstly the discriminatory comment, which I get no apology for. I then get spoken down too regarding the policy is only the 1 burger.I challenge this as ridiculous! And after returning to the store a second time, i am made aware that the driver had clicked to say 3 minutes away and he was not ! Hence the ""acceptable stone cold meal"". Committed to what is morally right, I contact uber again in a bid to speak to a different employee, who initially seemed OK and i explained the issue, I then asked to speak with manager regarding new info, to be told you get one chance to speak to a manager, and that I have to accept the ¬£2.63 refund for a ¬£28.34 meal in which none of it was edible.

"I placed an order worth ‚Ç¨50, adding to the over 20 orders I've made throughout this year, on my Uber Eats account created in Nov 2017 (as soon as it opened in Lisbon).I can count on one hand the number of times I've spoken to support due to minor issues, such as incorrect or missing items. Every time, the support team was extremely attentive and resolved the problem.On this order dated 4th of September, one of the products was Salmon Tartare. The product description reads: ""Shari, Salmon, and avocado cream"", and the image clearly shows a generous layer of avocado cream covering the Tartare.Unfortunately, to my astonishment when I received the tartare, it only contained two ingredients, rice and salmon.I immediately contacted support to report the issue, expecting they would offer a fair compensation, as they always had the few times I experienced similar problems.To my surprise, Uber Eats' support this time dismissed any responsibility, stating that ""merchants might not include condiments if they are not listed on the menu."" When I replied that it wasn't a condiment, but a missing ingredient, and that it was clearly not only in the image but in the description, they responded that ""Although we know this wasn't the experience you were expecting, unfortunately, we can't issue a refund.""Following this unfortunate reply, on 5/09, I asked to speak with a supervisor and have since been ignored. Attached, I'm sending the photo of the product from the shop vs. what I received, as well as the exchanged messages. To conclude, I'd like to mention that the cost of the Tartare is ‚Ç¨6.50, in an order of ‚Ç¨49.39, which makes this whole sad situation even more ridiculous.","Date of experience: September 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Jo√£o Ricardo Silva,Trust Pilot

"For a few months, I had a monthly membership that was $9.99/m. Out of no where, I was charged $60 for an annual membership(this was in July 2023). I never changed or canceled my monthly membership, nor authorized to be charged for the annual membership. I chocked it up to a glitch, contacted customer service, and they refunded me. I continued my monthly membership for 9.99 for a month, then decided to cancel it all together, because I wasn't using it enough to justify paying for it. Woke up today to a 14.99 charge from UberOne on my bank account. [Follow along, because this get confusing]. Contacted customer service, asked for a cancellation and refund. I was told because I had already been refunded in the past(that annual membership I never signed up for), that they wouldn't refund me. So I asked why it was 14.99 instead of the monthly 9.99, he told me it was for a 3-month membership and I was ""only charged 14.99 instead of the standard 30 for three months"" as if I should be appreciative. He then explained it as ""You canceled the annual membership, but kept your monthly membership, so you were charged for a 3 month membership."" EXPLAIN to me how that makes sense. I never should have been charged for the annual. I shouldn't have been charged for the 3 months, after canceling it all together. And I shouldn't have been charged for 3 months PERIOD because I never signed up for it. He and I went around in circles for 15 minutes then he hung up the chat.

"Don‚Äôt bother. We won‚Äôt be using Uber Eats again. At least not for our local Pizza Express (Muswell Hill). Hard to tell who‚Äôs really at fault but neither side knows what the other is doing. We waited 2 hours for one pizza for my daughter; Uber Eats have no customer service to speak of, of course. The app just takes you round in circles, getting nowhere except to the same unhelpful generic pages. At the 2 hour point, we drive to Pizza Express, where they looked up the order on their system and it showed the pizza had been picked up by Uber Eats, even though our app was still saying waiting for pick up, and moving the estimated time on by 10 mins every 10 mins. The Pizza Express people said they get problems every night with Uber Eats where drivers don‚Äôt bother to wait (or can‚Äôt, due to parking restrictions) so no one picks up the order; or it gets picked up but doesn‚Äôt make it to the customer. In the end we managed to cancel our order and Pizza Express made my daughter a fresh pizza, which took about one minute, and we were out of there, vowing to not bother with Uber Eats ever again. If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn‚Äôt have written this review, but the exact same thing happened last time we ordered from the same Pizza Express - also a 2 hour wait, also ended up with us picking up the pizza ourselves.

"Refusal to refund a food safety issue September 9th, 2023Today I ordered blueberries and raspberries as well as some frozen items from Target using Uber eats. When I went to wash the raspberries there was some mold outside but mold inside most of the raspberries. I took a picture and asked customer service to either refund the money or call Target so that I could pick up some good raspberries this week. They refused both and said there was nothing they could do. So use Uber eats to shop or dine in at your own risk. Yesterday when I ordered the same two items I did not get either of them so some of their shoppers need training. Before that, a shopper brought me tuna in a paper pack instead of chicken in a can. This is in spite of having photos of the items they are shopping for. Uber eats repeatedly asked me to give the shopper today a bad rating but that would not be fair to him as the mold may not have been something he would know to look for. Now this is interesting as Uber eats has no problem asking the customer to poorly rate the shopper when that person needs to make a living. Target would reimburse Uber eats for bad product but Uber eats does not consider it worth their time and would rather have food safety issues they refuse to address and poor customer relations.

"Company of 5 coming at Noon, expected delivery 1 pm.Restaurant said food must be ordered by UberEATS.Placed order at 12:30pm.  Screen info showed map with UberEASTs at starting point. Never left the restaurant. Delivery time changed by the 1/2 hour. 2 hours later called the restaurant and was told that the order had been delivered and verified.  NEVER GOT IT.  They agreed to refill the order and to choose a different delivery time.  This put us at 2:30 pm.  The first delivery person disappeared and a new one had to be called by the name of LEE.  I called LEE and got a recorded message. Another new delivery time was posted 3:30 Left a message telling him about the problem and wanted him to call me.  Never called. Another message that the order had been CANCELLED. Order had been paid for when order was placed of $95.  Manager at the restaurant was very accomodating.  The first order was verified as delivered.  Manager completed the order again for free with a few additional items.  We picked it up at 4:30 pm.  It was fresh and hot all within 1/2 hour.DON'T EVER USE Uber EATS for delivery.

"I was told the driver had waited for 8 minutes trying to deliver my food. As I was outside my premises waiting for him I beg to differ. I later noticed an unrecognised address on my app so presumably that's where it went. I was charged for it quickly enough and couldn't find the right button to complain/cancel/dispute so no chance of redress.

"When it goes well, it goes well as far as ordering and delivering, however, when it doesn't go right, it's so frustrating. An example: I made a pre-order 4 days prior for a work lunch to be delivered. On the date of delivery, it hadn‚Äôt arrived. When I raised it, Uber Eats said that they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it or issue a refund because I had made a pre-order outside of their timeline to look at these matters. Basically, I would have had to pre-empt that my order wasn‚Äôt going to be delivered and notify them in advance of delivery that it wasn‚Äôt going to be delivered.

"I've been having issues with Uber Eats for months. Lately, almost every order I've placed has had some kind of issue, whether it is missing items or incorrect items or food quality issues (my last order was missing one of the five chicken fingers that was supposed to be in the box, it had an incorrect - and smaller size - side, and an incorrect - and smaller size - drink from what I paid for). Uber used to be pretty decent at providing a refund or a credit when these issues occurred, so I kept using the service, but now they have stopped issuing any sort of credit or refund, stating that ""this order isn't eligible for refund at this time"". I've spoken to multiple customer service reps asking why it was not eligible, and none of them were willing to say anything more than the same canned response that the previous agent gave me. Finally, after hours of back and forth and complaining, a customer service manager came on, and... they said the same damn thing. I had to press again for more clarification, and finally, a manager said that it was due to ""excessive"" refund requests. I explained to the manager that I only request a refund when there is an issue with my order, and lately, their drivers have been causing ""excessive"" issues with delivering what I've ordered, which has caused me to reach out to customer service on multiple occassions. Uber is clearly not willing to correct the reported issues with their drivers and would prefer to punish their customers for choosing to pay them money to use their service rather than making things right. I suppose some of the blame is on me for continuing to use their service after having issues, but in the past issues had been few and far between with Uber Eats (especially compared to their competitors in my area), so I was hoping that this was a fluke, but sadly, it is now apparent that this is the new norm.","Date of experience: September 06, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Joshua Beck,Trust Pilot

"Uber Eats has terrible customer service. If your driver brings you the wrong or missing item, and it happens frequently, they will more often times than not refuse to give you a refund. It is illegal to charge for a product that you didn't get. They can improve through hiring better employees by giving them better income, so the mistakes are unlikely to happen. They can also refund you when your order is wrong. Perhaps, they should implement a system where the restaurant is required to submit a photo of the order, so it's obvious if the order was wrong or something was missing. It may not be a perfect system as it relies on driver honesty and puts in an extra step for busy restaurants, but if they're not going to trust the customer when they say they didn't get something, it's the least they can do.","Date of experience: September 06, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JE,Trust Pilot

"In Uber Eats, you only have 3-5 seconds to cancel your order and not pay a cancellation fee. This is very ridiculous! How come such a big company didn't think of this?!!!! At least after the final registration of the order, an opportunity of 1-2 minutes should be given so that if there is a mistake in the order, the order can be canceled without cancellation fee. It means that when the order is registered and the restaurant confirms it, the restaurant will start preparing after 2 minutes. It is very strange that as soon as the restaurant accepts the order, it is written in the software that the restaurant is in the middle of preparation, and from then on there is no turning back!! If anyone wants to cancel their order at this point, they will have to waive all the money they paid for the food, because it will all be charged for the cancellation fee, and that's too bad!!!! A few days ago I paid more than 170 dollars for the cancellation fee, I canceled my order in exactly less than a minute, but because three seconds after placing the order, it was written that the restaurant is preparing!! And when I talked to them, they only replied that the restaurant had prepared your food!!! How is it possible ?!!

"If anyone in my group the night I used Uber eats was in a state to drive, we would have been so much better off driving to the place we got food from. We were initially given an estimate that it would take 20-30 min to get our food, with a maximum delivery time that was about 50 minutes later. Our order time kept getting delayed and went beyond the ""maximum delivery time."" The actual restaurant itself was a fast food place with a drive thru that 10 min from us, so I think that the platform just had trouble finding a driver. The food was cold by the time it got to us. I only used UberEats because I had a 60% off coupon, but based on how much more expensive the food is on the uber platform, I will not be ordering from Uber eats without a coupon because of how bad the experience was.","Date of experience: September 03, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,MO,Trust Pilot
"My neighbour in the road opposite me ordered from Uber eats. However, the delivery driver got the wrong address. This has been happening more regularly over the past two weeks and when I answered the door I asked them what address they were looking for. They told me, and I said they had the wrong address and closed the door. The young man delivering apologised. However, the guy in the car shouted to me and told me I was very rude. I opened the door and told him I wasn‚Äôt being rude. I was just stating that they had the wrong address and shouted at me that it‚Äôs not his problem  and I said it was his problem because he read the wrong address to which he drove off shouting ‚Äú go f@%# yourself you thick b#%*^‚Äù. This was all captured on my ring camera. I was not rude I was not verbally abusive and yet I got spoken to in a very unwelcome manner.

"I ordered a food shop from Asda and booked express delivery for some strange reason my order was split into 2 (which the driver I saw said he had never heard of before and couldn‚Äôt understand why)  1 driver who was really helpful turned up with some of my order the other driver never turned up atall‚Ä¶I ordered 115 items and out of that I was missing 86 of those items. Asda confirmed that the other driver picked up that part of my order also witnessed by the other driver who said that he had left before him. So basically the other driver stole ¬£170 worth of my shopping, I am absolutely disgusted in what I have experienced today as majority of what wasn‚Äôt delivered was for my daughter who has severe allergies and obviously now the supermarkets are shut I am unable to get her stuff as it‚Äôs not stocked in convenience stores.As I say the driver who did deliver part of my order was very helpful and stood and spoke to me and tried his best to see if he could track down the other driver but was unable to and talked me through what to do about contacting Asda who also have been very helpful.I am not sure if you will be able to track down this driver but I feel he should take some responsibility for what he has done as I am probably not the only person! I did try to call to talk to somebody but because I didn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúactive order‚Äù the call abruptly ended. Also tried emailing this to every email I have found online for Uber eats but none of them seem to work!Obviously I can keep going on about how disgusted I am with this one particular person and that he thinks it is acceptable to take someone else‚Äôs food shop that they have paid for..But this also looks very bad on you as a company that certain drivers can‚Äôt be trusted.I would hope that they would contact me for more information to be able to look into this just to ensure that someone else doesn‚Äôt experience what I have today and end up going without things they desperately need for their children!","Date of experience: September 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,FG,Trust Pilot

Uber eats is a wonderful platform that has grown a lot but it still has a little ways to go. This was the first meal in about five meals that I've ordered off of Uber eats that was actually pleased with everything I bought. I wish that I could say that about all the items I've ever bought on Uber eats with the truth is a lot of things just don't deliver correctly or well. Also some of them have just been something I can simply make it home / very unimpressive. Like The Rice bowl company I ordered food from it felt very basic and dry and I was not pleased. This last company the Thai food restaurant was amazing and I would order online from them multiple times. But I wouldn't know unless I ordered from them before. That's the problem with Uber eats it is a wonderful platform to get things delivered I wish sometimes they would do restaurants further away and just make you pay a small fee because there are some restaurants that are far away that I can't access but I was still pay for knowing that the food would be like colder and I wouldn't care less if it was from my very favorite place. But I digress. This platform is wonderful I even got free delivery for the first time and I don't know how long. But it did help with making the choice of whether or not I was going to actually order delivery. Because sometimes the fees and everything after it all adds up plus tax just makes me say all right I'm going to make bowl of ramen. I will say that I checked my email and I had several emails that I let expire for multiple Uber eats deals. So if you're a person who doesn't mind the emails when you do want to use them they do have plenty of promotional codes offers and everything else. That I will give them an A+ on. I wonder if they do tests on the restaurant as far as does it deliver well within the radius that it says it can.,"Date of experience: September 01, 2023",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,SW,Trust Pilot

"Uber decided to limit my delivery options because they said and I quote, ""to many items being returned to store""  ""too many items undeliverable""! So if a customer is not available for instance I went to a guarded community and the customer was unavailable and guard would not let me through.  I called twice, he called twice and I waited but couldn't wait to long I had 12 other deliveries.  Just like UPS or FEDEX they don't wait they have a timed schedule.  The other day (2 days ago) I had a delivery to one address but 8 of the items had to be scanned separate. Essentially that means the customer order each item separately.  I knew this was very odd and unusual so I called the customer.   The delivery address was to Garden Grove, CA and the customer who's acct got charged lives in NY.  She said I tried to contact Walmart to tell them I have fraud on my bank acct.  I said OH Nooooo so I told her I will take them all back to Walmart.  She said thank you.  Mind you WE DON'T GET PAID FROM UBER IF NOT RETURNED.  I had to return no only the customer that had the Guarded gate community home but the fraud items which totalled 9 items.  Gee I thought I was doing a good deed by calling her to let her know something was fishy.  I returned the items and I did call UBER Customer Service.  She documented it for me and said you will get pad for returning them.  Im thinking ok like $5 or $10 bucks.  my total delivery and believe me these are SLAVE WAGES,  $25 for 6 different cities and I drove ALL OVER the place like usual.  Honestly im almost losing money because inflation.  I take the items back to Walmart.  Two days later Uber puts a message on my acct.  We are limiting your delivery options because WE FOUND FRAUD ON YOUR ACCT.  WOW........Now doesn't that just sound coincidental!!! I return a bunch of items but then all of a sudden fraud on MY ACCT.  So I wait a day.  Today this morning I got a message from Uber stating You can no longer do CERTAIN DELIVERIES.  Which now LIMITS MY INCOME EVEN MORE!!! So I document my delivery by copying my deliveries I did the other day and how much they paid me.  VERY STRANGE I got paid $86 dollars instead of $25 for returning them to Walmart.  I asked myself why so much more?  but Im slaving daily so I graciously accept it of course.  Ive done 1700 deliveries for this slave job!  Then I look at the full payment for Uber as well.  OMG they made a lot of money from this Whole fraud thing!!! A LOT!!!! Then I asked myself ""who pays for all this""?  does Walmart lose money and pay Uber??? Or is the poor lady who's acct information was stolen pay for all those fees and it was like $102 dollars SOMEONE LOST because of fraud on the poor ladies acct. Uber made a total of $156.80 for all deliveries.  I wish I could have saved her number to make sure she didn't get screwed.  Another lady that day was not home and in a gated community I couldn't get into and called and no answer.To sum it up ""IM THE ONE"" being punished because if someone isn't available and I can't access their property to drop off their item and or now these fraud items being returned its MY fault  for any given reason I could not legitimately deliver.  Now Im not allowed to do Walmart deliveries.  That was a good chunk of my income taken away from me for reasons not my fault.  Thats not all I noticed they get out of paying the ""healthcare stipend"" by not accepting my healthcare insurance card""  ITS INSURANCE!!! they keep asking me to send them a photo of it for 2 years now they won't accept it.  No answer as to why!  I don't like that Uber NEVER has a HR dept.,  NO MANAGER TO TALK TO, NO MESSAGING AREA unless you have an ongoing conversation about an issue, you only get to deal with these out of country foreign customer service people that you barely understand the accent.

"Title: Disappointing Experience with Uber EatsRating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2/5)I've been a loyal user of the Uber Eats app for a while now, but my recent experience left me extremely disappointed. I ordered food and eagerly awaited its arrival, only to receive it ice-cold.I immediately contacted customer support, hoping for a quick resolution, but to my dismay, my request for a refund was denied. This is unacceptable. As a customer, I expect my food to arrive in the right condition, and when it doesn't, I should have the confidence that the issue will be promptly resolved.The lack of support and refusal to refund for a cold meal has left a sour taste in my mouth. It's disheartening to see such a decline in the quality of service from a platform I used to rely on.I hope Uber Eats takes this feedback seriously and works on improving its customer service and quality control.

"Placed an order through the McDonald's app that came to just over ¬£26, and UberEats was to deliver it. We're sat in the living room keeping an eye out the window for the driver to pull up, and also have a dog who never fails to hear someone approaching the house. Get a text to say it's been delivered. Bit odd that there was no knock, and also that we didn't see or hear anything. Opened the front door and there's nothing there. Called UberEats and they refused to give a refund, as according to them, the delivery was completed without any issues. ¬£26 spent, no takeaway, and essentially called a liar when I contacted customer services. If you don't want the risk of having your evening ruined like this, don't use them. Even the girl at the McDonald's where I placed my order said that things like this happen with UberEats more often than they'd like.","Date of experience: August 29, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CU,Trust Pilot
"Im actually shaking as I write this. I ordered to my work as im the only person in and can't leave the shop. The driver rang me demanding I come up the road to meet him, I can't do that as I can't leave the shop. He then came to me shouting and demanding money for the hassle I just caused him. The reason I ordered for delivery was because I can't leave. So to be abused like that was ridiculous. He even threw my food at me. My hot chocolate went everywhere.

I have accidentally signed up for their membership without knowledge. I then canceled it immediately when I realized  and issued a complaint when I saw they charged me. No refund was given so I called my bank. My bank then refunded me the money they took. This was in February 2023 and after this I left Uber Eats. Yesterday I rejoin Uber and connect my card incase I wanna purchase anything. Today is august 2023 I look at my bank account and see $11.29 taken from my account. I contact Uber and ask them why they did this. They explain it‚Äôs because the bank gave me my refund and not them so they are now taking the money that the bank refunded me back. I explained that I resolved the issue with the bank already and they have no right to do this. But I was told that there are no further actions they will take and they won‚Äôt respond to any more messages on the issue. I understand $11.29 isn‚Äôt that much but it‚Äôs the principle.

"I recently wrote a review about failing to receive my food order.  Later that day I tried ordering again.  This time I received my order with zero problems. However, I just realized that although I received a refund for my  lost order, I had to pay the $4.00 tip to the driver!  That seems odd given he delivered my food to the wrong address.  Also Uber Eats suggested that I clarify my address in their App to avoid future confusion, and it turns out that it is actually correct!    That was a tad annoying.  Anyway, just minor issues really, and I will nonetheless keep ordering from Uber Eats.","Date of experience: August 24, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,MA,Trust Pilot
"Horrendous company. You can‚Äôt contact a human if you are having problems with your order. Our order was late so I tried using their absolutely awful chatbot to investigate this, it canceled the order because it has limited chat inputs with which you can interact. Then when I contacted them about a refund they dismissed me and assigned blame to me instead of the terrible chat bot. Avoid ordering with uber eats at all costs, use their competitors instead, some may charge more but at least they don‚Äôt steal your money when they cause an issue.

They forgot something in the order for my son and also filled up his drink only halfway. That‚Äôs unacceptable. I went back and forth with Uber eats customer service and nothing got resolved.

How is it my fault anyway, that the restaurants are constantly messing up! Why am I being penalized for it? The restaurant should be held responsible for their mistakes. Maybe even removed from the app, or something, after so many complaints. Not keeping customers money when they mess up smh. Restaurants should be double checking orders prior to going out, seeing how the driver can't. We are relying on the restaurant to get it right and UE to back up their service. UE and restaurants are making money off of us by not giving refunds when they should be, especially for missing and wrong items! I will not be using UE again!

"We placed a McDonald‚Äôs order which was delivered 1 hour after it had been prepared. As you can imagine it was inedible, cold mush (it had been sitting for so long that the paper straw wrappers had disintegrated into the actual straws). When complaining on the Uber eats phone line we were told by a customer service representative AND a manager that this was acceptable and within their guidelines (despite both admitting they wouldn‚Äôt eat food that was 1 hour old). When I asked what the acceptable guideline was for food preparation to delivery time I was refused this because they‚Äôve apparently been instructed not to give out this information. As a customer I‚Äôd have thought I should have access to the guidelines in signed up to. In any event, the rude customer service manager eventually just hung up on me. The delivery on just eat and Deliveroo is cheaper and you actually have a chance at having an issue resolved if you have one.

"The worst ever food delivery company. I wish there was a rating zero rating for me to select. Twice this year Uber Eats drivers did not deliver the food I ordered. They just disappeared off the system. When I contacted Uber Eats on both occasions, the customer support told me that the driver had followed their procedure and had contacted me twice when that was not the case, as they did not ring me at all. Based on this Uber Eats refused to refund my money. They had standard answers every time I communicated with them via the help support. They could not think out of the box. In my opinion, Uber Eats has given their drivers an easy way to steal from customers. They only believe what their driver tell them even when they have taken your food for themselves. There is no accountability. It is so sad that you order food and their drivers steal it and Uber Eats don't do anything.Following the most recent incident, I have had to go to the retailer I ordered from and asked them to investigate and possibly look into not using Uber Eats anymore.","Date of experience: August 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Adenike Olunloyo,Trust Pilot

"Extremely unhappy with the service from the driver and the customer service afterwards when I'm trying to resolve my concern. After 2 hours the driver cancelled the order. No call, no reason, nothing. I had to chase up the driver and follow up everything.  He stated that he had collected the food, and had it in his car on the way when he car trouble. After I followed up, he did appologise, however,  no instructions or reasons to follow. I did receive an automated reply from uber stating that the money has been refunded and I can now reorder again and they'll deliver it when possible. Firstly, a 2 hour wait, then it's cancelled. I received a message on my phone that my order was being prepared. Great. Then another message later that it's on the way with the driver. Good. However,  after I had to chase up what was going on, I called the restaurant and they said that the food was never collected and still waiting to be picked up. Not ideal. Then I ordered the same order a second time. Was charged by uber for placing a new order as directed by the ""support email"". Once again, your order has been collected and on the way by a new driver. Just under 3 hours later we receive the food. When we bring it in. It's stone cold. Further enquiries, the food was never made again, and it was the same food prepared when we placed the order now 3 hours earlier. Unable to consume food or reheat due to moving into a new place and awaiting for appliances to heat, cook or even warm the meals ordered. Hence the reason we ordered in. Now, it's been approximately 11 days and still no positive action has been provided or any customer feedback offered. It seems its all automated. They continue to reply with the same questions, replies,  and responses when I have taken 3 separate attempts to get this rectified. All I want, is a team member to either message me via social media or email to truly attempt to help me. I've waited over a week before submitting this feedback, hoping that after 2 attempts on my end that it'll be resolved. But after a 3rd try from my behalf, I get the same automated questions that I've actioned and answered. Extremely frustrating that a customer needs to follow up Uber Eats mistakes.

"Last night we ordered from a restaurant. I'm not naming or blaming the restaurant because they had the food ready and in the driver's hand on time. Just wanted to get that out of the way. Uber eats is the problem here. This isn't the first time we have had problems with them, but last night they sent me a 50% off coupon and I said let's give it another shot. That was a mistake! I ordered at 5:15pm and the restaurant is only 3.4 miles away. 5:35pm the food was picked up and the app said my delivery person was on a bike which concerned me. The short trip is much longer on a bike, and a trip I wouldn't want to take personally. Also the time for delivery shot up to 6:10pm latest delivery time as they put it. We'll that came and went. I text the driver and they claim to not have my address which I promptly text her. Another few minutes pass and according to the app driver hasn't moved. Uber calls me around 645pm asking if it's ok to give the driver my address. Of course they would need an address to make a delivery, have these people lost their mind? I tell them just cancel and refund my money. They then tell me that's another department. Great so I hang up with them. By now it's 7pm we are hungry and no food according to app this delivery person is just sitting at the gas station, probably eating my food. So I get back on the app to get help finally find the correct combo of buttons to push and they cancel my order. They made sure to let me know i wouldn't be charged for canceling my order! Now this really pissed me off! First of all...if they miss that latest delivery time you are entitled to a full refund. Second trying to make out like they did me some kind of a favor canceling my order for free is BS. I reordered from the restaurant picked it up myself at 725pm and back at the house by 735pm. On top of that I ordered from the restaurant website and avoided all the fees and the food itself was cheaper by almost 5 bucks.","Date of experience: August 14, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,HC,Trust Pilot

Which is a violation if she‚Äôll eat my food for my kids she will tamper with anyones food the did nothing to the black young lady when I confronted her she ran from my porch not wanting to answering a simply question.

Another point the shop owner hung up on us (I wanted to be mean at this point, but my mate took the phone and was lovely) Finally we got a call from the driver who was a solid hour at best away (this was roughly 3 hours after the order) and at this point it was easier to send someone to a shop to get everything at half the price.

"After repeatedly receiving promo codes for a substantial saving from Postmates (owned by UberEats), I placed an order. I needed to leave my house by 6:30 PM and I ordered before 4 PM. The estimated time of arrival was 4:40, and the latest time was estimated to be 5:05. This would have given me plenty of time. I kept watching the times change and finally called at 6:05. The driver still hadn't picked up my food and each time I checked his location he was further away from my house. He started out about 3 miles away and the restaurant is only about 1 mile away. At the time I contacted UberEats he was 3 towns away. The CS Rep told me I was next. Aside from the fact that I could no longer wait for my order, I can't imagine how awful it would be by then, after sitting around for 2 1/2 hours waiting to be picked up. The CS Rep actually tried to pacify me with 20% off of a future order! No. Just no. I canceled my order, and closed my account.

"Ordered a McDonald‚Äôs through the MyMcDonalds app (operated by UberEats) and it arrived over 2 hours later, stone cold, with the McFlurry melted all over the rest of the food. Called up and was promised a refund. One month later, no refund. You can only call a number and they are so rude and unhelpful. They provide no emails to confirm the action taken and have a a speech which consists of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going around in circles so I am terminating the call‚Äù. Usually this is used for abusive calls, but oh no. They use this just because you are for your refund and for an update.

"Absolutely shocking customer service. There is no way to contact them to complain about anything other than an order!! I purchased a gift card but beforehand I read through all of the terms and conditions and nowhere on it did it say it can't be used on grocery orders!!!!! However, when I have tried to use it, it won't let me and says it can't be used on groceries which is wrong and illegal given the false advertising and lack of any mention of it in the terms and conditions!!! Now I'm 30 pound down and can't use it. I've contacted them and I'm just being ignored!!!

"I stopped using Deliveroo recently as the quality of their service has gone very downhill recently and now, I will no longer be using UberEats either. I have a long history of abysmal experiences with UE‚Äôs customer service but this latest experience  has truly been the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I submitted a late evening order on August 5th from a nearby co-op, for 21 items totalling around ¬£40. When the driver arrived,he handed me 1 bag with 3 items in it and asked for the code, which I gave him (assuming the rest of the bags were in his car) then he tried to leave and when I asked where the rest of the shopping was, he said he accidentally dropped it off at the previous address he was at and he‚Äôll ‚Äògo and get it‚Äô and he‚Äôll ‚Äòbe back in 10‚Äô, and before I could question him further he jumped into his car and sped off.Obviously he never returned. And of course, UE sided with him because I gave him the code. To be completely honest, this is the behaviour that I have come to expect of UE and Deliveroo delivery staff, as this kind of thing happens ALL the time across all these sorts of low paid zero hours delivery gigs. And while I have had countless frustrating experiences with UE‚Äôs customer service team, I have never had an experience this dire. Upon contacting UE immediately to report the incident, approximately 2 seconds later they came back with a copy-paste response to say they would not be refunding my 18 missing items, totalling ¬£35 worth of groceries I never received. After days of back and forth messages on multiple platforms, they claimed to have investigated the incident fully, but refused to give me a single detail of their investigation and would not budge on their decision. In the end, I have filed a chargeback with my bank and that seems to be progressing in the right direction. I just really don‚Äôt think a company with such loathsome customer service rats can be a sustainable way to function. Such a deceptive and immoral company. Seriously, customers and employees alike need to stop putting up with this abhorrent service and boycott it.","Date of experience: August 05, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Kt Moon,Trust Pilot

I just want to know if we can pick tips or if they changed that, and they will NOT answer me.

"I would not give even one star for Uber Eats and its DRIVER whose name is JACKSON ANTONIO. Yesterday was my daughter's birthday. I live in Greenford. I ordered food from McDonald‚Äôs in the Westway Shopping Centre using Uber Eats. It was not the first time, and never ever any driver had any problem reaching my address. THE DRIVER DID NOT ARRIVE AT ALL! I saw on the app map that he stopped at the other end of the road, which was just a 1-minute ride from me. I texted him that he is in the wrong place and he needs to drive a little bit further, but he was messaging me back something in Portuguese. Then a message came that he tried to contact me, which was absolutely a lie. It was me who was trying to call him many times, but he just rejected my phone calls and I was texting him many times, no reply. Maybe because he did not speak English. After I got a message that he cannot localise my address and he had just gone away. Then I received the photo of my order being left somewhere outside the building. It was not my address. So disappointing. Kids were hungry. How can a driver be so irresponsible, with such bad communication? What he has done to my order I don‚Äôt know. I lost almost ¬£18. Maybe it is not much, but how can I trust this company again, that allows such irresponsible people to work there, without knowing basic English? I complain to UberEats, but the reply was that I am not eligible for a refund, because the delivery person tried to contact me (which is FALSE) and he waited for 7 min to deliver the order (at the wrong address).","Date of experience: August 07, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Alina,Trust Pilot

I spoke to the restaurant and discovered the delivery driver who was a MAN was using a FAKE ID that belonged to a WOMAN.  I reported this to Uber eats support.  They did not care about the non delivery, they did not care about the FAKE ID.  I thought the non delivery could be a common complaint but it appears so was the FAKE ID as the support were nonchalant suggesting this is not the first time this has been mentioned.

"I placed a large order with a restaurant based on its proximity and time to deliver. I received a confirmation moments later showing that the delivery would be much longer than I expected and I had a large number of small children to feed. I looked to see if it was possible to cancel the order and there was an automated cancellation request, when I selected it it said that the order had been canceled and that I owed a cancellation fee of $339, The entire amount of the order. This makes no sense since if I had to pay for it anyway I may as well have the food delivered. The cancellation was processed less than 5 minutes after the order that was supposed to take more than an hour to prepare was submitted. I immediately reached out to customer service and it took two days to finally get in touch with them. They refuse to refund my money based on the order having been submitted and the restaurant already beginning to prepare the food. I went around and around with them multiple times before calling the restaurant only to find out that the restaurant manager said that the restaurant was not paid for the order because it was canceled, and they never made the food.I disputed the charge with my credit card company because I never received anything for my payment. The money was refunded to me but now Uber is billing me for it. I have attempted to contact customer service I've told them the restaurant was unpaid and didn't make the food and they've done nothing but offer me a $25 credit. The problem is that now I can't use the app without first paying the $339. The $25 credit seems a poor exchange for $339 for food I never received .I wouldn't have probably worried about it if they had charged me a $25 cancellation fee or if they had told me in advance that the order could not be canceled or would be charged in full anyway but none of these things happened. As it is, they expect me to pay them $339 for food that they never made and never delivered. I have tried to appeal to them that I can no longer do business with them, and that in my lifetime I will be worth much more as a customer than this $339 but no one seems to care. They just repeat the same information which is that they can't refund it after the order has been placed but in that case I should have been made aware of the fact before it allowed me to cancel it.","Date of experience: August 07, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CK,Trust Pilot

"I don't use Uber because I have had issues previously with their Uber drivers, I know Uber don't care about anything but money. My friend ordered Uber eats to my place on the weekend, and the driver delivered the food and then left, whether he actually left I am not sure about. 30 mins after the delivery was handed to me, the driver was back and buzzing my unit, I answered the intercom as i assuming he dropped something inside the complex and needed to come get it. He told me he needed to use the toilet and asked if I would let him use mine. I decided to do the right thing because Uber probably wouldn't care to ensure their drivers have bathroom access, they are reputable for being a poor employer and poor service, so I let him in to use my bathroom. When he came out of the bathroom, I expected he would than me and leave, but he wasn't leaving, he stayed near the door, looking around at my place. He seen my cat and started calling it over to which it ignored. Then he proceeded to ask me if I lived alone which made it clear he was not there because he needed to use the toilet. He couldn't from where he was standing thay I had a friend with me, but as soon as I told him another person was with me, he very quickly got himself out of my unit. This is extremely dodgy as he clearly didnt come to my home needing a bathroom, he either never left and stayed for half an hour, or he came back to target me because I am a young female and he thought i was alone, and wanted to suss out if I lived there alone. My friend contacted Uber via the app and told them what happened becuse we both felt uncomfortable about what happened, and Uber just sent a generic response to pretty much say sorry for the experience, and shut the conversation off. They are not looking into this incident and the driver will continue to try look for single women who live alone. I already knew Uber would do nothing, it's typical Uber to not care.I am wanting to warn everyone about using Uber that their drivers are untrustworthy and will try and target perople home alone and try gain access after the delivery is done. Do not trust Uber! They allow this to happen under their watch. Stay safe and avoid Uber, you cant trust your address with their drivers as you may be targeted. I have never had this issue with any other delivery app, it seems to be an issue with Ubers drivers, and probably because they let them get away with it and do nothing. I am now banning anybody from Using Uber at my home, apparently not using Uber myesf wasn't enough to avoid their problematic drivers.","Date of experience: August 05, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NB,Trust Pilot

And when i couldn't connect the driver back after he called me once  to get my food from him. It just doesn't let me connect to the driver and he has gone somewhere else with my food which is fantastic because when i call the restaurant they are not in control of the drivers.

"These delivery app companies are ripping consumers off wholesale! I've been trying each and every one of them for the first time this year and they're all the same. Somehow, in spite of charging you so much to deliver your order, you will either get sent the wrong order or some of the items will be missing. When you try to get a refund, you're given a store credit that doesn't even come close to covering what was lost.For instance, I ordered something today through Uber Eats for $12, which--when all put together--almost cost me $24. Okay, fine, I get that this is the price to pay for convenience, but at least have the decency to give me everything I ordered. In my case,  of course the costliest item was missing and I was only given a $2 credit for an item that was over $6! And I was charged almost $12 in fees, taxes and tips! But I only get $2 back?This is absolutely unacceptable, and Americans need to start contacting the attorney general in their state to go after companies like UberEats, Door Dash, etc. Take screenshots of your items, customer service response, etc. and write your attorney general!","Date of experience: August 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Stranded NYer StrandedNYer,Trust Pilot

Really awful experience using UberEATS. Ordered fish & chips for delivery. It was a relatively short journey. The food arrived stone cold. I've used Just Eat every week for 4 years from the same fish & chip shop and never had a problem. The fish & chips are delivered fast & always hot with Just Eat.

Terrible service. Half my order was missing. When contacting Uber eats they refused to give me a refund and and Uber eats support were very rude. Customer service needs to improve vastly.

"My recent encounter with Uber Eats left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. I had ordered from a merchant, but to my dismay, they cancelled my order right after I booked it. Annoyed, I had no choice but to place an order with another merchant, which thankfully got delivered eventually.The real nightmare began when I noticed the sum of ¬£35.27 debited from my account for the cancelled order. Attempting to rectify the situation, I desperately tried to contact the merchant through Uber Eats, but surprise, surprise, there was no viable option to reach them! I had to resort to using Google search to find their contact details.Upon calling the merchant, they washed their hands of the matter and directed me back to Uber Eats, which, as it turns out, is no walk in the park to get in touch with. It's almost as if they purposefully avoid addressing pertinent issues like ""Why was I charged when my order was cancelled?"" in their Help page.After jumping through hoops, I finally managed to contact Uber Eats through an alternative means, but guess what? They outright refused to assist me since more than 48 hours had passed. Now, let me clarify that I did try to check my account just a day after the incident and noticed the amount was ""Pending."" So, naturally, I assumed the charge wouldn't go through.But no! Uber Eats decided to go ahead and charge me for an order that was cancelled by the merchant. What kind of absurd policy is that? Why should I be penalised for their inability to keep track of cancelled orders? It's ridiculous and infuriating!This whole experience has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I will think twice before ever using Uber Eats again. Their lack of customer support and the unjustified charges have completely shattered my trust in their service. I strongly advise against using Uber Eats unless you want to risk being ripped off for a cancelled order.

Customer service is not assisting me and keeps fobbing me off or the person I'm speaking to leaves the chat. I checked out an order for the desired items at the desired cost. Which I have a screenshot for. Then 20 minutes after checking when my food will arrive. It showed up more than double the price and added 2 extra items  WHICH I DID NOT CHECK OUT WITH. I tried to contact the resturant to stop the order as Uber Eats app had clearly glitched. No answer from the resturant. I then called and messaged the driver to say not to pick up my order. No response. Before my order came I then reached out to Urber eats online chat and was told they can only help me once my order was complete!?! And then as you guessed it left the chat. Spoke to various other members of your team for them to also leave the chat. One said the chat was only to discuss live orders and they cannot help as mine is completed. Contradictory to what the first person advised.Therefore when the delivery driver came I took what I rightfully ordered and told him to return the two extra items I did not order (but yet still paid for)I therefore want the refund for the two extra items I didnt order and didnt accept. I paid ¬£41 for one chocolate waffle!!Please tell me why your customer service continues to fail me on every attempt I make to resolve my issue?I have opened a dispute with PayPal which was my payment method and I would appreciate somebody contacting me. I have a screenshot of my correct order total and a screenshot of when it changed. Luckily I was able to capture this as on a different section of your app it showed my true order.I want my refund that I am rightfully owed or I will be taking this matter further.

Called the Uber delivery driver straight away to explain what happened (in case she had accidentally forgotten to hand us a bag) and she just hung up on me! So I called back again, no answer this time, so left a voicemail asking why she'd  hung up and could she call back to see what we could do about it. No response so called McDonald's. They said we need to speak to Uber about a refund so tried the app help which was next to useless as I didn't have an 'active order'. Never again!

"I'm a delivery rider and I also order take aways frequently. I can say that between three major UK delivery apps which are Just Eat, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats; Uber Eats stands in last place while Deliveroo takes first. I rarely have any issues with Deliveroo since they were able to tackle its rider's wrong doings who were using fake GPS and hold orders while delivering food from other apps or even the same app in which the account might not even belong to them because most are illegal imigrants who pay rent for it.Just Eat has the similar problem and most riders use between 2-4 Stuart accounts (Just Eat), takes one order while holding their GPS from other mobiles in the same location, accepting an order in their different accounts, holding them there while doing another delivery.This really isn't fair for its costumers because they paid for the order and also for the delivery and they expect to receive the order nice and hot which rarely happens. I've e-mailed Stuart and Just Eat countless times trying to explain to them what goes on and they don't seem to care.The app that I consider worst for their customers, whose riders abuse their system is Uber Eats. Uber came up with a strategy to favor themselves but I believe it backfired on them and they are really losing money. Using as an example, Mc Donalds; If the riders accepts an order that is paying 2.70, most will not deliver it because it's not even worth the wait during pickup. What they do is accept the order but do not pick it up, wait for about 20 minutes then reject the order while a colleague of theirs is also waiting and see if that same order will popup on his mobile with an increased value which is usually doubled the original value. Depending on the riders, they keep doing it until it's paying above 10 pounds and they hope it pops up in one of their many rented uber accounts. I once ordered 2 milkshakes that took almost 2 hours to arrive and they were as warm as the sandwich that came with it and I knew they did this method with my order even when I messaged them asking them to please not do it. I reported them to Uber and I believe they did nothing about those riders which is very sad.As I said before, I'm a delivery rider and also a regular customer on these apps and I put myself inside the customers shoes when I deliver. I am terrified that these apps don't do anything to improve the customers experience while knowing that the major problems are the riders who are causing it.I'm only ordering my take aways with Deliveroo until these other companies decide to take action against these type of riders and start to favour their customers.","Date of experience: August 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,WT,Trust Pilot

Initially I was told that none of my payment information was acceptable. I placed two different types of payment possibilities on the app or attempted to and it said that they weren't accepted. Then reviewing my account I was charged twice. I contacted chat. I was told it was too advanced for them and someone would email me and then the chat was disconnected. It definitely has not been worth the hassle.,"Date of experience: July 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,BV,Trust Pilot
"Ordered from Uber today and was shocked at the level of service received from one of your drivers. Not only did he fail too find my flat, when being directed by myself. But when he found it he never rung the buzzer and in the space of 2 mins my husband walked down too collect and he was gone. Complained too customer services, but even they failed too understand what the driver had done. After showing proof of the conversation with the driver they still refused too issue a refund and said the reasons for it was apparently the driver made effort too deliver. What a joke of a company! Very loyal customer for many years with uber one membership and this is how they treat you.","Date of experience: August 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,N A,Trust Pilot

Placed an order and paid fir express delivery. Was told it would delivered to my place of work by 5.15pm. At 5.25pm I tracked order to be told the driver had been sat outside for 7mins and tried calling my number twice both of which are lies. I work on reception of a car dealership showroom made up of ceiling to floor glass windows and I can see who drives in and out and certainly if a car was sat outside for 7mins. I call had no missed call on my mobile. I tried taking this up with Urber who told me I was it entitled to a refund as the driver followed their T&C guidelines fir delivery. I tried for a 2nd time and got the same response. So I am down by just short of ¬£19 l an that is their gain & their driver also kept the order as I checked with the food chain I got it from and order was not returned to them.Decusting customer service!!DO NOT TRUST OR USE UBER EATS.

"I was threatened and shouted at by a delivery driver because i did not have my PIN .......I live in a block of flats and had to go downstairs to collect my food , I did not notice when ordering a PIN number would be required , when i told the driver i did not know the PIN or indeed have it with me he started shouting at me that i will not get my food and will not get a refund , this shouting became more and more  aggressive and his fist was raised and clenched on a couple of occasions , i was then blocked from entering the lift to go upstairs despite telling him several times I would go upstairs with him and try to find the PIN number , after about 15 minutes of his abuse he finally came with me and looked on my laptop for the PIN , after which he snatched  the receipt from the bag and left , by which time my food was only just warm and I was left shaken  ........A report has been sent to Uber and i wait their reply.","Date of experience: July 29, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tony Freeman,Trust Pilot
"Today was my first time ordering from Uber Eats so it's unfortunate it didn't go well. When the driver arrived, he had an order from a completely different restaurant and said that was the only one he was given. I didn't accept it.

Hence the 2 stars opposed to 1.I won't be using again since I can't trust whether it's a once off, though kudos to their customer service team.","Date of experience: August 01, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,RM,Trust Pilot

"No food, no moneyI really should have looked on here first before making my order. I ordered from a Chinese restaurant and was patiently waiting for my food despite the delivery time increasing and getting longer on the app. Eventually it said delivered and I was surprised as we were home and no delivery, so we checked the door‚Ä¶nothing. I tried calling the driver several times and when he eventually picked, it seemed like he couldn‚Äôt communicate in English or he was just avoiding my questions. He never even attempted to call me to confirm when delivering. I was given a code when I placed the order but it is obvious the code is as useless as Uber eats. I don‚Äôt understand how my food did not arrive and I have been charged despite given a code to avoid this. Well, I then escalated to the help team who were very unhelpful and said I couldn‚Äôt be refunded after review. I asked them to explain what was reviewed and how they couldn‚Äôt explain how they arrived at h the decision and just replied the same thing. I was very hungry, upset and sad as I had just lost ¬£30 and no food. Avoid this company if you don‚Äôt want to lose out.","Date of experience: July 31, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,OM,Trust Pilot

The final delivery driver was excellent.  I ordered food at 1350.  The problem I had was drivers kept accepting the job then 10-15 min later dropping the job, so my estimated 1420 delivery kept changing and finally got my food at 1521‚Ä¶.one hour AFTER the initial delivery time and 31 min after the ‚Äúlatest‚Äù delivery time.
