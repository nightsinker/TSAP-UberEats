"Lately it's very common to wait over 2 hours for the food, while the order is passed on to 3 or 4 drivers before one finally cancels. What in the world is wrong with this app? If more than one driver passes on, it should auto cancel. Otherwise I'm waiting for food that I'm not sure if it will arrive, and then it never does. Literally not rendering the service. Happens constantly. HUGE problem. System needs a change.","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bastian H,Google Play Store,,
"Love it. Great offers. Good selections. Food and shopping arrive at your door. The drivers are professional and courteous. No complaints on the services offered. Any time an order is wrong, customer service refunds, this doesn't happen frequently, but it can occur. It gets put right, right away. I am happy to use this App, it provides me with heaps of choices I wouldn't normally explore. Thank you","January 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Andrew Higgs,Google Play Store,,
"Very disappointed in this app. I've used it for a long time but the service fees keep increasing, sometimes up to $20 extra for a small 10 items order. Also, as I'm adding to my cart for promotions, the promotion disappears. Lastly, the prices for items are often higher than in store. Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store,,
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible. Drivers also seem to be rarely checked out by uber (different person turns up to who is registered) so security/safety issues. Some of the drivers are also pretty rubbish and constantly cancel once they accept leaving you waiting for ages for another delivery person and food then turns up cold.,"January 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,broomee c,Google Play Store,,
Don't like the fact u can't get a refund unless u take a picture and it takes a second for u to be able to rate so u can go back to ur receipt and say something is wrong by then my foods cold. I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt. I thinking the rating part should activate right after the order is completed and in the ratings be able to say if something was missing or not. Besides that it's great,"January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Teresa Anderson,Google Play Store,,
"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store,,
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store,,
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store,,
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store,,
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store,,
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store,,
"Overpriced and misleading app. Got an email that said "" get 60% off your order as a welcome back"" so I decided to order for once. Clicked the email link, it opened the app, took me to the restaraunts that accepted this offer. I get to checkout and the discount does not apply. Spent 20 minutes trying to find a way to apply the discount, but there was no where in the options for it. Following that, the order was incorrect and cold. Unacceptable. Uber died and its corpse delivers disappointment","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Zane Elliott,Google Play Store,,
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store,,
"Uber eats has become the most pointless app ever, there is almost no upside to it anymore. 1. Where the prices used to be reasonable they no have massive markups 2. Where the delivery was quick and efficient, it has now become incredibly slow. 3. Where there used to be amazing specials that allowed it to be affordable , it's no longer there. If you like waiting 40 minutes fpr food that you pay 20% more for, is cold, that you pain stakingly give instructions to get there. Here's your app","January 21, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Alistair Mckay,Google Play Store,,
"Update: bug has been fixed. On another note, to uber eats drivers. Stop leaving the food in front of doors. The majority of front doors open outwards. Meaning that food gets ruined or can't be access easily because it is blocking the door's ability to open. ~ App seems to have a bug. When I click on an item the screen goes blank and I can't order any food.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store,,
"Mysterious disappearing promotions. Looks like a promotion, you click on it and it disappears, or your order gets rejected and the promotion disappears. Customer services are obsessed with screenshots of disappeared promotions because they clearly don't understand the concept of disappeared... Used to function and offer good promotions, now not worth it.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,N H,Google Play Store,,
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store,,
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available 😒. I got charged over £6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available. I'm an Uber one customer, but I'm really thinking of deleting the app. Total rip-off money in delivery fees. There is no option to talk to a human being so frustrating.","December 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Nikolay Ivanov,Google Play Store,,
Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes. The blue dot of my actual location is in the right place. Tired of having to walk 500m to find my food sitting in someone elses driveway. I've provided feedback in the app.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Craig Galbraith,Google Play Store,,
"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange! Fix it","November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel C,Google Play Store,,
"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3. Certain restaurants get un-favorited every day for some reason. Even after adding back they don't appear in my faves.","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jeremy B,Google Play Store,,
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store,,
"Terrible Customer Service. I reached out for assistance with my account. I stopped receiving promotions and all the promo codes experienced errors and would not apply. I was sent one email and then the rest of my requests were ignored. ""According to the Terms and Conditions, Uber reserves the right to disable promo codes/marketing campaigns. You can still continue to order from the app."" This is not customer service. I requested a full refund for my membership fee and received no response. Bad!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Watson,Google Play Store,,
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour. By the time I was able to contact support, it had already arrived luke warm.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel L,Google Play Store,,
"I wish I can post a picture of you can see how much they charge you for a $20 meal it is $7.98 for fees, this has nothing to do with the delivery, which is an additional $1.89! There is absolutely no way you're going to be able to tip the delivery guy with the amount of fees they're charging to! I don't stop using the app, but I absolutely do not tip anymore! You can get your tip from that $10 that charging me for the service! Everybody should feel the same way! Do not tip, let UBER TIP THEM!","January 8, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,luis hernandez,Google Play Store,,
It user to be Easy to use. Very useful. But now if you have issue such as items missing or the restaurant not following orders which means the food goes to waste along with the money. Honestly annoyed with the changes. And any time you go to support about it they don't want to hear and brush you off saying nothing can be done.,"January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KittyCatNyx,Google Play Store,,
"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store,,
"Was with Uber one for almost a year. Started getting a message that I can no longer use coupons that Uber themselves send me and which show up in the app... Because I breached the terms and conditions. However, they will not tell me which ones. I've already read all of them, but still I can find no answer. The customer service is honestly really bad when it actually matters.","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Noah Rozenfeld,Google Play Store,,
"I definitely recommend uber eats over doordash they have a lot of good deals if you know which resturaunts to look at. However, I do wish that the Uber one subscription applies to all restaurants, not just a select few and it is rather on the exoensive side for example it costs me almost around $15 to order 2 thing from mcdonalds. But I digress at the end of the day it still is a good app if you can't go out because of the weather or if you're down right just hungry and ect","January 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tristan Moraga,Google Play Store,,
"Promotions may not apply when they shop. So followed the link they sent for 50% off of Sprouts order. It came to around $39. I get my order. It is missing a few items, and I got charged $63. They refunded the original amount and charged me for the higher amount without my consent. BEWARE..The will not fix any promotion issues, even if it's their fault. I was a member of Uber One. Don't use this app. UPDATE: They said it was on their end but will not fix it.","December 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,lady j,Google Play Store,,
"Deliveries have been great. No major issues in my area lately. However, I just received the notice that the $5 credit for late deliveries is being removed from Uber One. I understand I could just go out and pick it up, but I'm paying for the service to be on time, with no compensation of late orders. It's just another side effect of inflation.","January 6, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Amanda Newton,Google Play Store,,
"I love the deals, but as an Uberone member, I'm incredibly frustrated. For the past few months, I've been purchasing from uberone stores (free delivery), but they've been charging me delivery. Customer service has told me there's an issue with my account, that they've bumped it to their tech team, and that I should retroactively contact customer service to get my delivery fee refunded after each order. Today, they told me too many refunds, so they can't refund any more. Their fault, not mine.","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Itsokjo,Google Play Store,,
"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store,,
"0 Stars. Edit- service is still sub-par. Delivery drivers do not call and just leave food outside to be stolen or just get cold. There are always issues. Period. Uber Eats makes it worse by vague and unclear help and suppet features. Everytime I have a new issue, it seems the help options are more limited and harder to navigate. Cancel and uninstall this worthless app.","November 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,George Chalifoux,Google Play Store,,
"Last year, there were a lot of mistakes with my food delivery. I gave this app another chance. I am getting the same problem, I had enough. I spent $30 on some food when the order is messed up, they Reimburse me $5. It's not worth it anymore. I'm done with Uber Eats. I prefer cooking at home now or just pick up the food myself. It's been fun. It's time to go","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,michaellewis,Google Play Store,,
"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me. This is clearly a setting on the app but sucks and usually sends the carrier far away from my location, is not something on the same route but a total detour. Now my food is always cold or not appetizing.","November 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Richie Crotin,Google Play Store,,
"I'm done ordering from this app, every time I order I have missing items and they do NOT allow refunds. I had to go to McDonald's just to get my missing items one time. They gave a 15% off discount and some of the items weren't there and it was almost like I never had a 15% discount and instead just didn't order the items even though I did. More like Uber Eats your discount!","November 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Michael Hauser,Google Play Store,,
Insufficient funds then I transfered required money and Uber still perpetually stuck claiming insufficient funds when I have double the amount available. Uninstalled reinstalled still jammed. How can devs overlook a flaw so basic and fundamental. Mustn't want my money. Wonder what your bosses think of this. No way to contact either unless already paid for order. I'll go with menulog. Just ordered menulog and it was no hassle! Also an immediate way to contact them. unlike Ubers shady practices.,"January 16, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Layne Lorenzo,Google Play Store,,
"Lots of extra fees, drivers can't follow instructions, people delivering food aren't the ones shown in picture which is a huge security risk. When something goes wrong you can only email and wait for a response. The Uber One savings is a hoax as they still add on extra fees. It's no longer worth it to use Uber. It MUCH cheaper to just order through the restaurant and pick it up. So I stopped being lazy and do that most of the time now.","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ray R (Racie),Google Play Store,,
The reciepts do not clearly show the total amount of items within multiple combos. It only shows the items that are included in one combo.

"Placed a Subway order for 2 sandwiches to a location less than a mile from my house. Waited for over an hour, and my order continued to say ""pending"" with no indication of a delivery driver coming. An option to cancel was on the app; after canceling I was emailed that I would still be charged for the order. Chat and telephone options were no help for either refunding or still getting the order.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kelly B,Google Play Store,,
"You pay so much money just to order food, and that's not considering tip. Why is the delivery fee $10, I'm paying an additional $10, and it's not tip? I've just had it. It makes more sense to order directly from a restaurant and pay cash and tip, without the ridiculous additional fees. It's so expensive and it's just not worth it. Most of the time you pay more for food when you order through this app also. Just a rip off all around.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lora M,Google Play Store,,
"It's expensive , you're paying at least like 10-12 mote bucks than if you bought it at the actual restaurant. Uber one saves money but not much. They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience. My biggest issue is simply the over the top fees even with uber one.","December 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ration,Google Play Store,,

"I have Uber one, and they offer me promotions through the app, but it fails to redeem.

Worse delivery app and service ever coming from someone who has used it for years. Despite having multiple issues the only help you'll ever receive is from automated responses that didn't even read your message or address it before closing it. The delivery estimate is always wrong and usually adjusted 3x before actually en route. Overpriced and less reliable compared to other apps with huge emphasis on HORRIBLE customer support.

"I have roughly 20-30 places near me that I can order from and Uber One does not cut any delivery fees from a single one of them... It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived? Service fee hikes in price when you get deals/promos.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,rin kagamine,Google Play Store,,
"It's rare for me to give a one star review. But I think I should. It is impossible to contact their customer support. They are simply non existent.

Ordering from your competitors from now.","November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Albert S,Google Play Store,,
"There are many unreliable drivers and no way to properly get help with the order other than cancelling. I've had meals that are picked up and then the driver cancels after I've waited over an hour.

"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food. While the delivery service by itself is convenient, I feel I should never be paying $40 for a meal that is only $12.99.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Love Of Nikki (ForTheLoveOfNikki),Google Play Store,,
"The app itself works great, but the service has dropped off a huge amount since I started using this. All of the hidden fees are ridiculous leading to outrageous prices. When the service sucks so bad, this is unacceptable. Lately, almost every time, I'm either missing items from my order, or my delivery is ""taking longer than expected"". Upsetting.

"for the most part this a great app, easy to use great selection of food choices to chose from and so on. However when it comes down to the total pricing of everything it's pretty wild. they over price everything and give minimal return to the driver while keeping a big portion of the price to themselves. they won't let you tip more than about half the total price which is complete BS.

"Ease of use is OK but you can't see what restaurants you've favourited very easily, you can't find them again very easily, and when orders go wrong it's not easy to resolve. Also, many uber eats drivers phones don't actually work so you can't call them when they don't drop the order at the right place which is really painful when you've waited over an hour for the food sometimes.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,M Anonymous,Google Play Store,,

"Terrible AI customer service in general, yet great service from the delivery drivers so far. The restaurants and stores don't have to replace missing items or inform you. They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives. I was charged £67 for 2 bottles of tonic. No logic in that whatsoever. Call your bank and report them.

So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get?

"The platform had a bug which led to the initiation of a wrong order. After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end. In other words, they are purposefully and knowingly keeping a loophole in their application to make you pay for false orders.

I've tried multiple approaches to try and get it right with no success, entering the address makes it seem correct but then the GPS directions given to the drivers is wrong.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want. It always reloads the Uber Eats starting page and you have to manually navigate back to where the notification was supposed to take you. Especially annoying when attempting to rate an order. Help is utterly useless and fixes nothing. Keeps deleting my home address and there's no way to fix it so everyone just gets lost when delivering. No support number to call. Also can't unsubscribe to Uber One because it hid the option.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Todd Turner,Google Play Store,,
Mostly a good app with a good choice of restaurants to choose from. However I had a personal account and business account with them and I used to pay alot of money each month for Uber taxis and so on but I had many problems with my account with them and I could not even speak with someone by the telephone.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous. You're better off ordering delivery directly from the restaurants where you pay for delivery and tip or just driving there.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Roman Ivanyushchenko,Google Play Store,,
"The app has a few issues, as far as GPS goes. Mainly, getting the driver to your address if you live in a more unique environment. Refunds and customer complaints are compartmentalized, and often ignored. They do not allow you to double order from any other restaurants you would want to. The inflation of menu items is very high, with tips also being pushed hard.","December 14, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shane Morey,Google Play Store,,
I ordered food from a restaurant and i had an issue with the payment. But the order was still processed without me paying. I looked for ways to pay but couldn't find it. The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues. But then i canceled the order as i had to go out later only to be served a processing fee of 25 cad. If my payment was the issue then you shouldn't have gone ahead with the order.

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up. If you refuse their subscription, they purposely overcharge, and there is no real breakdown of who gets the service charge money.","December 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia White,Google Play Store,,

"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store,,

I called the restaurant, and they confirmed my food was picked up. I called ubereats, and they said the driver claimed to have a route issue. Ubereats refunded me the money, but the experience of waiting for your food to arrive to only have it canceled sucked!

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store,,
"The service is getting really slow so I cancelled my uber one, and it's supposed to be good until the 6th of December but when I cancelled they stopped the service immediately.

The app is ok. It often crashes or there are errors with summing up totals with promotions. There are also a lot of issues with your Uber wallet being used for payments.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability. It's also easier to track your order and navigate. I have noticed recently It's become harder to communicate with someone about your order which is the reason for 4 stars.,"December 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shannon Lorenzen,Google Play Store,,
Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store,,
The map used by the app has gotten worse. Initially it was off by a few feet now it gives the delivery person a complete different location for drop off.

"The app is slow and prone to freezing if browsing for any extended period of time.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

"THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY! For the last 2 months, their deliveries have been MISSING some or most of the food we paid for. The first few times, they refunded the missing items. Not anymore. Ordered food for the whole family and got ONE thing. They won't refund because there's apparently a ""limit"" for missing claims. It's simple: you pay for something, you get it.

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store,,

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

"The app itself works however, you have to pay a service fee, the items are increased price from the restaurant, and even with a paid monthly subscription, there's still are delivery fees sometimes.

Still a wonderful service. Been using this app for 3 years and it has helped with my husband who has a brain injury he loves that he can order his own food/groceries and feel some what responsible for somethings in the house.

I've not had a problem until today but it was a huge problem. Support is non existent and because of this 4 drivers had their time wasted and there was literally nothing that any of us could do about it. I tried to contact support to sort it out and was told they would get back to me within 8 to 12 hours. This is utterly ridiculous. Either have better support or more capability for customers and drovers to correct issues themselves. Or better yet both.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kathryn Carter,Google Play Store,,
"Drivers eat your food, missing items half the time, delivery times blowing out by an hour almost all the time, drivers using fake accounts and different cars, no customer service, this application and company is a disgrace.

"Worst app ever, I tried a new subscription to Uber one, and i didn't like it. Now they deduct money for next month subscription even before the defined date, although i didn't want it.

I will not trust this app anymore.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KANAAN MOUSAEI,Google Play Store,,
"Sometimes there are errors with orders made by restaurants, sometimes an order goes missing. But, so far, I have always been fully refunded in those cases. It's up to the restaurants to add themselves to the list, so you get some dumb things like 24/7 places 'closing' on uber eats. The selection is pretty good otherwise.","December 23, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Liarra “Heart” Sniffles,Google Play Store,,
"Absolutely shocking app. Promo codes not applying, as well as dates and conditions changing without notice.

"Stopped using it when my orders from a restaurant that was a block away me would take trips around the city before getting to me.

"They said I wasnt charged for cancelled order but I was indeed. I sent screenshot to their support but keep getting automatic response. Avoid this app if you don't want your money stolen. Prices are also bumped and delivery always has extra stop before and food arrived late and cold. Better use Wolt, which has more to offer, is more transparent, and has actual customer service.

So if they do this two hundred times a day🤔🧐🤬 I will never use this app again. Update 11/14/23... I'm back and did go back to the app after a while.

"I have litterly wasted thousands of dollars on this app over the years! Everything cost more then it does if you were to buy it directly from the restaurant but I put up with that for the convenience. I have run onto so many problems but I let so much slide.

"Too many fees, the service it's self works fine and I got my food in a timely matter. My issue is service fees. I can understand having a delivery fee if your driver is driving an excessive amount of miles to drop your food off. That's no big deal. Then there was a freaking service fee that was almost $10 on top of the delivery fee, %25 tip I left, and taxes. What the hell is a service fee? This should be more clear.

"While the convenience is amazing, being able to pull your phone out and get food to the door. The prices have been inflated to a larger degree than if you were to either order from the place directly or pick it up. For example, let's say a pizza would cost $30 to pick up, delivery from the pizza place would be a total of $34; while on Uber eats with everything fees, paying the driver the basically forced tipping culture your order could cost $56","January 13, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Vin You,Google Play Store,,
The app doesn't apply the meal deal prices.

"Ordered food. Uber delivery driver called and said the restaurant was out of one of the items I ordered and that I would need to reorder. I cancel order after placing a new order because there was no option to replace the out of stock item from inside the app. I get charged the full amount for canceled order that was the same as the second updated order with a substitute item. Uber delivery driver was amazing, though. Customer service being a bot is absolutely garbage. 0 stars. Uninstalled.","November 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Seth,Google Play Store,,
"A complete rip-off. There are so many types of fees you have to pay at the checkout. The food items are 30-40% more expensive than if you went there in person and on top of all that you jave to pay services fee, taxes and delivery fee. A $20 items (which includes 30-40% additional charges that vendors charge) easily turn into $35.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Aryan S,Google Play Store,,

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store,,
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store,,
"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store,,
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%.

I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store,,
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store,,
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store,,
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

"Pretty much always 40% off promos! and seemingly, you get an offer for a 3 month free trial of uber one every 4-5 months and after your trial ends and you cancel the membership they offer you a discounted month subscription for $0.99!

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store,,
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store,,
"No longer receiving any promotions nor any holiday promotions. I had to open a second account at one point and rarely use it but it's getting tons of promotions while the account I actually use has all of a sudden stopped receiving any of the Spend & Save promotions - I'm far from happy.

"Supervisor Jude instructed me to reinstall the app in order to fix a restaurant's improperly entered menu. Problem exists on your end, not mine, duh. So, if I want to order food that's listed and get the appropriate price, I can't use this app on my phone, tablet or website since the menu itself is incorrect. This has gone unresolved for about 2 months.

"I downloaded your app just so I could leave a review telling y'all that you need to stop accepting orders from places who have their own delivery staff. It's bad enough that you let people get away with not tipping people who work for you directly, but now you're taking money away from people who don't even work for you.

Most recently a driver just didn't deliver the order, said he left it at my front door, the delivery picture showed he hadn't left it at all- it was my front door with nothing near it AT ALL, no help from uber support. Wouldn't even contact driver to see where he ""left it"". Wouldn't let me edit the tip.

Horrible customer service. Spent over 3 hours waiting for food to be delivered from a restaurant 2 miles away.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day. Biggest issue is with drivers but that's not really ubers fault. This is so much better than calling a restaurant only for them to not write it down correct or for me to forget to order something.

Use with caution.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Emmanuel McGuin,Google Play Store,,
My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house. Also the fees are over priced making it hard to tip the drivers that deserve it (the ones that don't steal).,"December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angel Boling,Google Play Store,,
"$11 service fee?? The order is already $31 (originally $53 before discounts), and they expect me to pay an extra $11? Apparently for ""basket size and cost related to the uber.""

Sometimes places are closed and it doesnt tell you until after youve tried to place an order, and the pound of delivery fees is ridiculous.

"Uber advertises delivery times they can't meet. Then when your food is cold and soggy after an hour waiting for it, you have jump through hoops to get any sort of credit. Refunds apparently are out of the question. Increased fees on food and service charges do not go to your driver. Drivers basically work for tips.","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Netta Smith,Google Play Store,,
"Changing my rating from 5 stars to 1. Uber does not care for their customers. Their delivery people pull up smoking weed, none of them ever look at delivery instructions. NONE OF THEM SPEAK ENGLISH. And if something goes wrong with your order, they just cancel it and that's it. No discount, no benefits, nothing. Just cancel the order and now you have to re-order and wait again. The membership IS NOT WORTH IT! After a few good discounts, they raise the ""taxes and fees"" so there's no point.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Cortez,Google Play Store,,
I wanted to buy food for pickup using a coupon but the app removed the coupon automatically from the purchase. I called the restaurant and cancelled the order.

Screenshot everything you do/every coupon that is advertised on your account (not that it'll necessarily help). Three times now I have tried to use a promo that was advertised when you open the app. Sometimes the promo will just randomly disappear and you won't be able to use it with your order.

I use Uber one to help with those fees and, in some cases, still can be $4 for ""taxes and fees"" on a $20 order. Also, at no fault to Uber, my order is missing or has something wrong with it 2/6 times roughly, and Uber eats kind of gives you a set amount they will pay.","January 9, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,David Pollard,Google Play Store,,
"This is the WORST company I have ever experienced. They make you think you are saving money, but really, you are being charged extra with all of their hidden fees. For example, I just got a Safeway order that actually cost $356. But they charged me $395. They even used my Safeway rewards but still charged me more. Their customer service is abhorrent.

You'll be charged fees for canceling an order early even though most items are out of stock which you're only told about an hour later and the delivery person hasn't left the store yet.

One of the worst customer service support you can get.

Uber eats support did literally nothing, refused to refund or anything at all, and then closed the order and disallowed any further contact with support for the order.

2 times in a row drivers have either only delivered half order or no delivery at all. Customer support sucks and hangs up on you if you're lucky enough to get a human. I always leave large tips.

You write and unless they actually solve the issue, you have to continually explain again and again to different people that just don't know what they are doing, they won't read the thread or they simply can't, all of them bad. I started a simple request due to a glitch on a promotion for Eats Pass Members and boy, they just don't get, can't, they don't read, they mix other tickets with it, honestly, I don't have enough space here to explain.","January 14, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Solann Díaz,Google Play Store,,

Uber does not(or if they do they do a terrible job) quality check the restaurants they sign on to their service. They do not allow you to speak to someone to make complaints. The system they have is not nearly nuanced enough to allow you to say how you were ripped off by a restaurant.

I talk to the customer service it took me 4 different agents to have someone even check my problem properly. Then one says it's a merchant promo that they can't do anything when it's clearly the ubereats promo. Then the next one says it's expired. when it still says 2 days for that same promo to expire.

Ordered thru Uber they give my order to a girl on a bicycle that is clear across town. By the time I got my order 30 minutes late it was cold and half of my order was missing. The driver wouldn't reply back to me and when I reached out to Uber Meagan said there was nothing they could do. I'm deleting this app and never using Uber again.

"Only 3 local restuarans available. NONE of the Chinese take aways or fish and ships shops available. Not everyone likes pizza or indian food.

Uber Eats has a much nicer and easier app to function/navigate. As for prices, some items are actually cheaper/equivalent to doordash in price!

I've tried giving feedback on this multiple times, I think the food is better left in a hot place in a restaurant while we wait for another driver.

You can't even give a bad rating to the drivers that cancelled. The help chat is no help, they just waste your time and tell you your driver is close to the restaurant... and then it gets collected 30mins later!

Bad customer service. They have a lifetime refund limit and will just stop refunding missing or cancelled orders. I was charged twice for 1 order and they refuse to refund me. It just feels illegal.

Uber eats have become the worst. You cannot even get decent support when your order is delayed so much that you can see it is not coming. Orders change status to complete when nothing has arrived and you have to fight to get refunds even after they tell you it has been refunded.

"Sometimes my orders are good. They have often been canceled with no explanation, but Uber Eats has offered credits (when requested) to compensate for those negative experiences. The worst are stores often don't include condiments (e.g. Taco Bell, KFC) when added to the order. Few things seem more frustrating than 16 chicken tenders and no dipping sauces, or 2 dozen Tacos without a single packet of mild/hot/fire sauce, and happening on 3+ subsequent orders (so it's policy not incidental).","November 27, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Michael Ivey,Google Play Store,,
"Delivery driver took over 2 hours to deliver food. I called Uber initially when it was delayed 30 minutes, they offered 6 dollars to continue my order instead of canceling it. After another hour of waiting, I called back to cancel so I can order my food, however, because I accepted the 6 dollar credit, Uber told me I would be responsible for canceling. Absolutely unacceptable..... my food was in this delivery drivers bag for 2 hours before I received it and Uber told me to pound sand.","December 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Kim,Google Play Store,,
"Terrible service. The last few times I've ordered, the delivery has been delayed over 30 minutes and one time cancelled by the restaurant after being delayed until after the estimated delivery time.

Uber Eats sucks. They give a total when you pay. But later on they give you your official receipt via email and you will see there is a service charge. I tried to call them about it and they Said the price is as it stands.

I made a mistake while placing an order yesterday. Restaurants cannot make a cancellation even if they use their drivers! The instructions for order cancellation don't work and don't match the appearance of the app! And customer service is horrible!

"Was good until they lured me into a 1 year Uber One subscription 50% off, as soon as I signed up all the usual food promos stopped e.g. 20% off next 5 orders. I used to get promos nearly every month, but now, nothing! The support team are useless, they never seem to read what you're saying and keep asking the same template questions, resolving the chat without answering your question.

"Uber's service is a complete disappointment, offering no real assistance. The $96 Uber One annual subscription is a total rip-off. Their chatbot evades issues, leaving customers stranded. Adding two orders to the same driver, regardless of distance, compromises food temperature. I feel scammed by Uber One, and a refund is demanded. The insults from the driver and atrocious service make this experience unacceptable. Deduct any received discounts and return my money promptly. Rip-off App.","December 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hector of Troy,Google Play Store,,
Shady customer service practices. Offered $30 off coupon to use for first order. App error occured and charged full price.

A cheese chilly nuggets of 4 is sold for 4.8€ on Uber eats than a 3.9€ of actual price; 23% surplus).

Customer service have gone downhill. Its like they don't care anymore. I have ordered a lot from here & when there are problems I report it & they would ask for proof and refund. I've been using the app for over 5 yrs & now all I get is a message saying that my account has had a lot of refunds/ adjustments so now I don't get anything.

I absolutely hate this service!! Cancelling everything I have associated by them. 5th time in a row something has been cancelled now ruined 3 meals and 2 dates. I will say they are great if you order something that's not really that important because they are not reliable nor communicative.

I clicked to activate the gift card, and it assigned it to my work email, which I can't access. So the 30 dollar gift card is gone. Once you click on it in your email and accept it, whatever email it's assigned to, it's there for good. I just feel bad for the people who spent money to give me a gift card.

"When Uber Eats launched, it was like all those companies, compétant at first. But slowly slowly over time it started changing as it gained customers, and no longer had the need to offer good and fair customer service. Be prepared to wait for your order and have no recourses as the wait time is presented to you as an estimate and therefore waiting time can easily exceed 90 minutes.

Canceled my order after waiting well over an hour. I saw 3 different drivers take the order. And 2 of them even stopped at the restraunt. I patiently waited and without warning the app just told me the order was canceled. Uber Eats wants you to tip the drivers first yet there is no accountability for dropped orders.

The inflated food prices are getting out of hand at restaurants. Especially when we are charged delivery fees. Where is the incentive? The rising cost of living doesn't match the stagnant living wages. This also rolls over on tipping the drivers that keep uber in business. I'd rather these delivery fees go 100% to them.

I've had mostly good service but I have had problems for instance once they canceled my 100$ order for roses 3 min after I placed the order and charged me 75$ and would not let me get the flowers I called the flower shop and they said I can pick up the flowers since I paid for them if Uber says I could and Uber would not help me at all they refused to give me my money or allow me to pick up my order which was paid for and confirmed by the flower shop.

"There are too many technical difficulties and app crashes, especially today. It's extremely frustrating trying to place an order. I am now realizing that these issues may have been caused by a recent powerful solar flare. I do still frequently have technical issues with placing orders, though, with the app claiming that there is no delivery available in my area when I know, in fact, that there is. And customer support keeps hanging up on me without actually answering any of my questions.","August 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Andi Roodzant,Google Play Store,,

"Been ordering on this app for two years. Over the years, it's gotten worse and worse. It is simply a money grab at this point. They charge a large service fee, and consequently they do not even show you your total bill until it hits your bank. It is simply a scam. My most recent orders have been delayed by 1 hour to 1.5 hours, and the customer service is terrible. The contracts are so ambiguous yet binding.

I spent 30 minutes creating a shopping list (which I was using because of a promo) and the poor shopper spent 45 minutes shopping and going through checkout only to find many of the prices for items was wrong (to the tune of a 35% overall mark up on my receipt), so much so, I received a phone call that the shopper had had to decide to put aside many of my items to fit within the amount alotted.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristina Scaman,Google Play Store,,

I'm not sure how a $40 order turns in a $75 order before tip without me adding anything to my basket. The second thing is the fact that for the last 3 months, I have not received a correct order.

Even ordering from a fast food restaurant where everything is set up to be as straightforward and simple as possible. Uber Eats manages to make delivery more inconvenient then getting it yourself.

Horrible changes to uber.,"December 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dan M (Scarrz),Google Play Store,,
"App overcharges. Gives a price for the takeout ablnd delivery and then at the end charges about £10 more. Very, very unclear charging structure or info prior to purchase. Because of this I will not be using any more. My opinion is avoid!","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,David,Google Play Store,,
"Customer service is hard to find, repeats the same corporate speak script over and over about ""being sorry for your inconvenience"" but never actually does anything to fix it. Constantly assigns drivers who take forever before heading to the store (one sat at a location opposite for 30 minutes before going across the street... the order claimed it would arrive in 15-25). Lift your game Uber.","September 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brendan Laurie,Google Play Store,,
"I often have missing items from restaurants. When I report it to Uber eats, they replies after 1 week and says 'this item is not eligible for refund'. I am paying for the food and not getting it.

The overall quality that you get from the restaurants has sharply declined over the last year. The app itself has become extremely glitchy in that if you use the reorder function make sure that you read your order very carefully before you submit. Sometimes it has a tendency to duplicate orders. Their customer service has significantly gone downhill making it almost impossible to contact anybody when there is an issue with the food that has been delivered.,"September 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ed Miller,Google Play Store,,
Uber Eats adda fees and such for themselves and the restaurants. The issue is they are also adding almost 30% to each menu item itself without telling you. The restaurant may charge $11 for an item but Uber Eats says the item is $15 when it is not. I feel this is a violation of the DTPA. It is highly deceptive.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terry Sangster,Google Play Store,,
"Used twice never again First order great. Second one from same restaurant took 1 1/2 hours. Paid for the express delivery 30 min, app showed food being prepared on time Delivery took for ages food stone cold. Issue reported on the day. Took them 4days to look at all issues and it's now our fault for not reporting the issue in 48 hrs so no refund. Never again not worth the risk. We know this restaurant well and know food was ready on time. Uber customer service is issue avoidance at it's best","November 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nigel Wood,Google Play Store,,
"Won't complete an order in the background. I often click the button to order, see the order get acknowledged, then switch focus to another app, theb come back 30mins later wondering where my order went. It just disappears into the ether.

It won't let me click on food items to add to my cart. Once I click on a restaurant and then select the item I want....I get a totally blank screen and I cannot order anything. I've restarted my phone. I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it. I have the most updated version of the app. I've changed my internet settings and even went on total data and then used my home internet. And nothing works. I'm about ready to get rid of it.

"There is a bug I had two carts for two different restaurants. I ordered the 1st one, which is OK, then clicked back. Once the app went to the previous screen , the 2nd placed automatically without my confirmation. I have tried to cancel the wrong order but uber told me that I will charged for the 2nd order even if the order is canceled so I had to receive and pay for it due to a bug in the app.","August 27, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ahmed Hafez USA,Google Play Store,,
"Overall it's been great. Sometimes there are some difficulties with the updates of availability of items, or if a machine for a drink goes down (ofc that is kind of out of uber eats control but the drivers can ask someone to taste or check up on it to see if they have been changed or not. The other problem I seem to get every now and then is either missing items and then failure to read simple instructions of how to put items to the right of the door and not right in front of it.....","August 27, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Rhohshahvong Niphol,Google Play Store,,

"Ordered food for over £40, never came in. Driver just took a picture of our front door, said it was delivered, and left with it.

"Always a good experience. It's super easy to order food, drinks, or groceries. My only sort of issue is with the frequency of changing the menu. Sometimes an item is on, sometimes it disappears for the weekend. It's very odd. I wish the menu reflected the actual menu of that establishment. Otherwise, I love the app. I appreciate it a lot as I can not drive or move around a lot right now due to injury.","October 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Christie Keyes,Google Play Store,,
"I'd easily give 0 stars if I could.... When you request replacement items rather than an automatic refund they accuse you of abusing them and use that as justification to end the call, it's just a shame none of the employees realise calls are recorded.

Uber one has become less and less useful and the higher prices compared to other apps makes it seem like an unnecessary expense. Update.

"The UI is not great for finding what I want and making adjustments to orders. Tipping after its delivered is nice, but results in email spam each order.

"I like the app, but the customer service is terrible. I placed an order and it said it was delivered, but it wasn't there. They must've delivered it to the wrong house.

That's ridiculous","December 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Parker Handiboe,Google Play Store,,
Every time we have an issue with Uber Eats the refund and inconvenience has never been equivalent to the amount needed to make it right. This has happened on several occasions but in this instance (which is the reason I deleted the app and will not use them again) is that we ordered a $15.00 combo from a fast food restaurant and the combo was missing an item. We received a $2.00 credit to fix the issue.,"September 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Northwind,Google Play Store,,
"Awful. Customer service is very helpful, but there's only so much they can do in the face of a company like this. Despite being a subscriber for many months, every one of my past few orders have incorrect/missing items. They now attempt to predict your address, and when you don't check it carefully enough, lies to you about whether the restaurant delivers to your house or not, forcing you to cancel your order, and then charges you 22 dollars for cancelling the order. Use a different service.","August 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jialan He,Google Play Store,,
"I've been using Uber for over a month now, and I absolutely love it. I mainly use it for food, so in that sense, it's 95% fast and reliable but 100% convenient and kind service.

"The app is okay but Uber is not an honorable company. We ordered pizza and apps. An entire pizza and calzone were both missing in the delivery. Uber eats gave me a refund for the two. The problem: we still needed food for the kids. I reordered ONE of the missing items and with fees and tip, I had to pay $6 more than what I was credited for the two missing items. So, I ended up paying more money for less food than I originally ordered. Uber refuses to make it right.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lisa Hare,Google Play Store,,
I only use uber eats when they send me coupons. The best discount to date is the 75% off up to 30.00 off an order. I would literally never use it at all if I had to pay all the extra fees with no discounts 😒 🙄,"December 10, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Kelsey Lowe,Google Play Store,,
"Download Deliveroo instead. Uber will constantly bring you the wrong order, or not show up whatsoever. Then when you call them to ask for a refund after their mess up, not only can you barely understand the operator but they'll be rude to you as well! I used to pay premium for Uber One but cancelled it a few months ago and it's gotten to the point where I've now uninstalled the app. You don't have these issues with Deliveroo, or any other delivery service, at least not in my experience.","September 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ryan Pengelly,Google Play Store,,
"Ordered groceries w/ a 40% discount on a $70 order. We're struggling for cash so this was the great to save a few bucks. We've used it a handful of times with no issues, but this time was horrible. After the order was delivered Uber said we had an outstanding balance, and the promo wasn't applied properly, so we went for help. The CSR's were AWFUL. They said nothing could be done unless we had screenshot of the promo. How the hell were we supposed to know this would happen? This app is a SCAM!!!","October 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ana B,Google Play Store,,
"DO NOT START THE FREE TRIAL! They make it impossible to cancel. Tried to cancel through the app, but it told me to call support, rang support and the call automatically ends as they 'prioritize customers with active orders'. Wrote a message in support, and days later got a generic push response. Surely this must be criminal.

"It's incredible how they always say that your food is gonna arrive at a certain time, and always get delayed like an hour. Also they have really sketchy fees that are only displayed to you in the last step before paying for your food.

"Orders generally get here before the started time. I've had quite a few orders with missing items, probably more times than not, but customers services always refund me for it, which is good, but sort of defeats the point of ordering on the app, if I then need to go out to buy the missing items...

When my order was clearly delivered to the wrong address (I had photo eveidence from the delivery person where it was dropped off) Uber's support was not allowed to refund me or take any other action because of the ""review"" status of my account. Uber has underdeveloped systems and no care for customers, as long as they get paid.","September 4, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kelsey Dawson,Google Play Store,,

"The app has some features that are hard to use/find like contacting support. It is easy to contact support about an order being messed up, which is probably the most important, but if you need something else there is almost no way. The amount of coupons available of you have Uber 1 or whatever it's called is actually crazy to me. Somehow every time I order delivery the price in the end is either equal to or CHEAPER than if I had picked it up myself. For that reason alone I continue to use it.","September 23, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Eric Richardson,Google Play Store,,
"The app is sufficient in aspects of ease of operation and the interface is wonderful too. Has all the tools needed for anything that could possibly come to mind. The whole Uber experience makes parts of life so much easier. Update: It seems after so long with an Uber One membership and saving a significant amount on their excessive fees, customer support indicates you as not eligible for compensation when your order is incorrect. This factor was never mentioned prior to subscribing and is shady.","September 16, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,grey,Google Play Store,,

"Canceled orders. Late arrival. Wrong food. It's just a non stop lost of issues. Did you know that uber eats allows drivers to cancel orders, no matter when during the process? As it stands in 2023, drivers are using multiple gig apps to pick and choose their work. If you are one of the unlucky ones, they will cancel your order and do something else.

The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost.

"My food was delivered cold because it was delivered from at least 3 miles away by a bike delivery person on a cold night. That was after two requests for a different delivery person, being hung up on and telling me I can not cancel without being charged. I was assured that if the food was cold I would get a refund if I asked for it. When I did ask for it I was told they are not responsible for temperature of food it is the restaurant fault of nat packing it right or because there was traffic.","November 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shari Katz,Google Play Store,,
"On the delivery section where it says ""Give a thumbs up for good delivery"" can you please move the ""thumbs up icon"" to the left, so that its the first icon in order. What is happening is a lot of delivery guys are getting the thumbs down because most customers by default select the first icon which is the ""thumbs down"" at the moment, i also made a similar mistake, and its affecting delivery ratings.

No contact made for this information via app or email before or after accepting order.

"Horrendous customer service! I've had numerous problems. Orders are never correct, and if you adjust the tip, they will attempt to charge you an incorrect amount unless you add to it. Uber cash is a lie. You must dispute with your bank, and they will fix it. So, they wrongfully placed an outstanding balance on my UE account. They falsely claimed I had to pay to fix it. I did not, but they fixed it. I reached out to support. Now I can't complete orders.

"Absolutely horrendous company. I will have to make a complaint, I did try to reach them out but there's NOWHERE to do so. I tried to issue an order and they didn't have some of the items I have requested. Then it was said: add items with other shops. I tried to add 3 bunch of bananas with 40% included. Not only I was charged 9 pounds in total for that alone, I also COULDN'T CANCEL THE ORDER. Nowhere said to cancel it and I kept on trying. Very low.","August 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Luciana B,Google Play Store,,
I understand that fraud is probably rampant but it's super frustrating that 80 percent of our orders is missing an item or made incorrectly and they have a limit to how many times they will make something right for you.

I contacted them this time because I had cancelled an order and had not been refunded. They replied that I'd had to contact them to get a refund for an order I'd cancelled, so I hadn't received my order or my money.

"I've had a very frustrating experience which seems to be a fairly regular occurrence at this point. My delivery person just stops in one place or goes the opposite direction of the actual restaurant. They then waste 10-15 minutes before ""opting out"" of the order as customer support called it.

"UPDATE: I decided to give them another shot, and would you know the service has got even worse. I strongly suggest using another app: door dash, menulog, deliver roo The inability to be able to talk to someone or actually write your complaint in the help section is a fundamental flaw in design and only done so you won't be able to voice the problems with the delivery service. Honestly support any other delivery app over the scum that created this.","January 8, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kailash Sivasubramaniam,Google Play Store,,
Customer service does nothing to help when food is stolen. They also don't update their maps to match Google. Had to take an Uber to work and it took me to their previous address. There's no way to reach customer support to get the address fix. Must be a way for them to make extra money when people have to use them twice when taken to the wrong place. This app has gone down hill and will continue to get worse.,"September 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Brice,Google Play Store,,
"App is really annoying.. resets while browsing and constantly targets the same restaurants. More importantly, restaurants regularly make mistakes missing or giving the wrong item. Uber will refund the particular item but no accountability to deliver the correct order without paying for new delivery and the erroneous item.

It's nice when they actually deliver your food nice and hot and not mess up but when they mess up! Boy is it a hassle to get a refund or credit! And sometimes they tell you your issue is not eligible for a refund or credit! That to me is ironic as you are ordering through them and so you are trusting their site so it makes it a bit hard to continue to want to order through them and just go elsewhere. I will say It is expensive but sometimes they throw nice discounts and have some nice choices!,"October 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Vanessa Ramos,Google Play Store,,

Unfortunately, your local store deals might not appear on the app, so you might be S.O.L. service is fantastic if you just want to stay home and have the food come to you.

The drivers never read instructions. I wrote them in both English and French. The instructions were to meet me outside at a corner between two streets. They never do and park on the other side of the building. I would always have to chase them around. I stopped and stayed out one time and they never found me.

If I could give negative stars I would. I have been a customer since the pandemic and have been constantly let down by this company. Orders are wrong or you get someone else's order all together. Sometimes they will refund you and other times they just keep telling you that the order in not eligible for a refund. I have a premium account which means I pay uber eats for this service.

So I go to cancel my order, and I'm informed they can't do that. 30 minutes of support chat later and they tell me they can cancel but they have to charge me for the driver's time.

Dispicable and souless automated service with zero customer assistance to actually help resolve issues. No notification when drivers decides to not to take order.

"Works fine for restaurants but poorly for items in stores. Lets you order items that are not available in the store. Just shows up missing items and they don't tell you about it till the receipt comes out 24 hours later or you spend the time to contact them. Also since most people tip drivers based on the order size, you end up overtipping by quite a bit unless you can figure out yourself what the new total will be (they don't tell you for 24 hrs) and update in the app within an hour of delivery","November 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Zebair Ali,Google Play Store,,

Driver did not follow instructions and delayed our delivery significantly. The app made it very difficult to report the issue and offered no clear way to rate the driver nor resolution.

I really don't recommend to use its not like hot it used to be. They charge extra and will remove items and mess the whole order up.

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers. I had a delivery driver steal my food and Uber (their only customer service is the in-app chat in which agents copy and paste the same responses word for word over and over again) refused to give me a refund. I had to file with my bank to issue a chargeback. Will be going to GrubHub. Never again.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sarah Gaestel,Google Play Store,,
Uber Eats is the least dependable delivery service available. They are never on time if they even show up with your order at all.

Obviously I wasn't satisfied with this response since it was their fault and they didn't fix it, so they passed me to another representative that changed the story to it being an account breach.

Makes sure there are no restaurants in your area to use vouchers on after you use the 2 out of the 5 uses you have available. Customer service is only on twitter/X and they do not read messages properly and use copy paste replies.

"Only slightly better than Door Dash. The drivers still miss entire food items to be included and /or order notes. Sometimes it's not even the person or car listed. They have their eyes on the next delivery while they are still working on yours, but what can you expect when there is no actual hiring process? Good customer service is a thing of the past so for now I'll just lower my expectations (and the tip) when things don't go correctly.","September 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jessica Tisdale,Google Play Store,,
"App convenient, but needs work. The website was atrocious, so I switched to the app instead, and while I am annoyed that there are SO many push notifications, it's ultimately way better than the website.

"Customer services is a joke, I'm still awaiting contact on a food order I received that was freezing and uncooked 6m ago. But the worst is the amount of promo emails and none of them ever work. Going to be stopping using this app, delivery fees push you to join uber one (or whatever its called) food always ends up costing double than going into the shop to actually order.

Most of the time it's just normal humans making normal human mistakes and I am fine with that. Ish happens, most of the time I get what I ordered in a timely fashion. The only is issue is that it costs a lot of money to order and I wish the order fees and services fees where not a thing so the price was not too much for the customer.","September 16, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Chinemere Kwesike,Google Play Store,,
"The service is good but the fee is a bit too expensive,it practically adds another 5 dollars to your order,don't get me wrong the food is worth it but the fee makes you a bit uninterested to use uber eats.

I was trying to view an ongoing order and the app glitches and opened an old cart and ordered $30 worth of food.

"I should not have to pay extra delivery fees on top of delivery fees to have my order delivered straight to me. Why are drivers allowed to pick up and deliver other orders far away before picking up and delivering one. My order sits there waiting, assembled, and I get a notification that the driver has another delivery, look at the map, and it's like 10km away!

"Its surprising that a multi billion dollar company can't fix a map in two months. My groceries keep getting delivered elsewhere by the uber eats drivers, and the smart ones call and let me know that the house address doesn't match with mine.

Very expensive mind you, but it's better than Just Eat which has the habit of losing your orders (losing them completely ""accidentally"" into the mouths of the delivery drivers, hmm...) . With uber eats you can see where the driver is on the map the whole time, so they can't scarper off with your scran. I've never not had an order delivered, with Uber Eats.

We moved to a new development and Google has already updated their maps but Uber has failed to do so. We are unable to put our address in the app to order.

Charging extra for priority delivery IS SO RUDE, when the delivery fee is already high enough - EVERY delivery should be ""priority"".

"My experience with Uber Eats has been absolutely awesome. My orders arrive on time, and when they are delayed longer than the expected time of delivery, as an Uber One member, I get credit to spend on another order. What I have a slight problem with is that restaurant discounts are not regular, like the one given for grocery shopping. I only shop for ready meals on Uber Eats, and so I will prefer discounts on ready meals as opposed to discount on groceries that I rarely ever use.","September 28, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Snazzy Yasmin,Google Play Store,,

Most of the time drivers are pretty on top of it I just hate when they leave the food right infront of the door and when we leave a note for request sometimes I feel like they don't read them and I always tip 😔 but ordering from here u run risk of the restaurant messing up ur order and its not the drivers fault the restaurants need to be more attentive and uber needs to hold then accountable.

"Since they launched Uber One (I am not subscribed) the service has deteriorated. Without offers the delivery and service charge are massive compared to their rivals. Their drivers now make multiple stops on the way, often this is when they are due to deliver my food so they are clearly doing jobs for other firms at the same time as you can see them driving to restraints miles away leaving my order late. Only reason not giving 1 star is It used to be good and the app is ok. Shame.","September 21, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Henry Coleman,Google Play Store,,
"Constant issues with orders, which is the fault of over paid fast food workers who can't look at a receipt and make sure every item on there is in the bag, but usually I was refunded for whatever was wrong or missing with no problem but then 1 day they just stop. No more refunds. Last 2 orders I made had missing items and both times I was denied a refund. This last order I was missing all of my PREGNANT wife's food and they would not refund me for it.","August 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,probably conservative,Google Play Store,,

"If I could submit a no star review, I would! I placed an order and the status of my order would not update on the app. I canceled my order but was still charged because the restaurant received the order and had prepared it. The app stated it did not deliver to the address. I spoke to 4 support agents and all they said was because it had be 48 hours, a refund could not be given. There's no accountability that the app was not functioning correctly at the time of me placing my order. Never again!","October 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lyndia Scott,Google Play Store,,
If your ever going to tip a driver make sure you don't tip on your card because they try to take the tip out twice. Then stop you from using the app til you pay the second transaction. My order came to 8.08 then added a 3.45 tip which came to 11.53. Well they took the 5.00 uber cash and 6.53 hold on my cc then they tried to charge me a separate transaction of 3.45 for the tip.

"I have had orders so late that everything was cold, you told me to go get it myself. I'm mobility impaired if I could get it myself I definitely wouldn't use your service. Today part of my order was missing, you gave me a $5 credit which will not replace what I didn't get because it will cost me $9 to reorder what I didn't get. You need a better method. But you try to convince people that it's cheaper to purchase a membership.","October 7, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Elise Miller,Google Play Store,,
"They canceled my order after I waited for an hour. Now I have to find something else at the last minute. There is no way to communicate with Uber eats, just with the driver and it's not necessarily the drivers fault. Uber eats is cold and faceless and does not care about customers. I'm deleting the app and never using it again.","September 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Marc Allen,Google Play Store,,
"No customer service. They are either using a bot or people that are only allowed to reply back with a script. Received an order that was not edible (freezing cold) spending more than £50.

"Only use this app if you have money and time. And by time, I mean HOURS. The reason why I say this is because the app is obviously not aware of how long the order takes. It does apologize for the 'inconvenience' yet offers no free option to cancel and order something else, even if it takes hours. I placed an order for a restaurant right down the street from the delivery address, and it took 3 hours for arrival. This app has no time limits, so if you're a diabetic, or ordering at work.

"Not once ever have I gotten everything that I've ordered. I am in Gainesville Florida, and no matter who I order from, the restaurants conveniently forget everything from sauces to entrees. The best part about it is that you can't even complain. The driver has no idea what you ordered and can't check it for you. Restaurants won't even take your call you have to call Uber eats and they can't send somebody out to get what you say you didn't get.

"I ordered from ubereats. The driver asked me to come to another location which is far away from me to take the delivery. I told him that he is at a wrong location and that he should come to the delivery address but of course he opened the timer by then and kept talking on the phone. When he moved towards me, he marked the delivery as complete and did not deliver the order. Uber would not refund me for their mistake.

Then I get an email saying I owe 50 more dollars. Customer service then says I need a screenshot of the promo. So tip if you add a promo to any of your orders take a screenshot or they will not help you at all and will not give you your money back. Don't order groceries through here.","October 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caitlyn Norris,Google Play Store,,

"Actually quite awesome. If you tip decently, your food gets delivered quickly. I mean what waiter is going to drive across town to bring you your stuff? And you tip them 20% on average? I joined Uber one, which is totally worth it because I save enough money only using this to eat about twice a month to pay for the membership. They also gives you lots of coupon / offers from places. I highly recommend you try it.","October 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Christopher Duggar,Google Play Store,,
"Food and restaurants are all good. But I'm sick of the promotional emails. I get 1 every week, giving me offers. Yet every single offer they send, when I try to use, says I'm not eligible for the promotion... so why the hell do you keep sending me them? I'm guessing to make u open the app and to tempt you. Even though they have no intention of actually giving you that offer.","September 22, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Adam Hawl,Google Play Store,,
"Terrible delivery experience, clear instructions were left for the delivery and the courier didn't follow them. I was in contact with the courier the entire time and they made no effort to get my order to me. The picture of the delivery shows them holding my food and not that it had been left anywhere. Uber Eats refuses to refund it saying the courier followed their policy. I highly recommend avoiding this service.","August 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dan Dunstan,Google Play Store,,
My experience with Uber Eats is that the promos don't work & I feel like they are charging double for a delivery order and they shouldn't be & since they took down the reward system this app has gone down hill and drivers they need 2 raincheck them as when my meal come it's freezing cold or they haven't given me my full refund I'm stillwaiting for a refund on an order while back so if anyone wants to use this app just becareful for what you purchase.(Currently Ripping me off) Needs improvement,"September 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Katy Nolan,Google Play Store,,

"Every single time I order something is either wrong or missing from my order. Customer service argues damn near everything and really doesn't like issuing refunds for incorrect orders. It's like pulling teeth. I was charged an authorization hold and the actual cost of my meal to ""confirm I can afford the funds"" so charging someone almost $100 for a meal only for $50 of it to be sent back in a few days doesn't seem right.

Uber eats it's a great app overall but sometimes you may experience poor customer service from Uber drivers which has nothing to do with the ubereats app itself .

"I had been using Uber to order food frequently and even though the prices are higher and had service fee plus delivery I liked you could monitor your order. However, recently, I have had an issue where one restaurant missed some of my order and was very poor.. I contacted Uber straight away as I was paying to be a Uber one customer and all downhill from here. They have asked me 4x for the same information and my answers not going to change, I'm wasting my time going nowhere, buy Uber!","September 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kelly,Google Play Store,,
"Horrible customer service. All orders have been late. And they know it because they track everything. Yet they don't give you a $5 credit. Like they promise that they do. And there's no way to contact customer service. And when they do give you a credit, it's Uber cash. It's never refunded to your card. Never, ever used this company, they suck.","October 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Andrea Cline,Google Play Store,,
"Every driver is great foods always warm or cold as ordered they offer great coupons this week is 40% off total bill. Their monthly fee is $9.99 which makes delivery free, discounts on rides, AND Uber eats always has some freebies or coupons. i made like 14.00 discount/coupon back on my first dinner order which covered their monthly fee. Can't beat that!","August 12, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Kristi Lynn Clark,Google Play Store,,
Very dishonest. - food prices for the same restaurant are more expensive than the other apps - won't let me see total with the tip included.

"Yall should make an option that you can choose to drop current driver, if they haven't picked the order up. EVERY time the person picking up has a rating below 90% my order is late or just before the latest arrival and the food is cold.

Personally it's been a few years now since I've had a bad UE experience and that was a one off I'd blame the driver or maybe poor street lighting for.

Up until now I was using deliveroo or just the McDonald's app but I've tried uber eats 3 times now and I love the fact I'm only paying 5.99 per month for all deliveries.it's also a bonus when you first sign up u get a spend £25 get a free £12 off ! You can't use it on alcohol but I bought me and kids £29 worth of Chinese got it all including delivery and service charge for £18 (was a pound service charge).

"Poor refund policy. Had a delivery where the food (burger) was raw and portion sizes were tiny for the price, went through the complaint process only to have a bot say it didn't qualify.

I highly recommend it.","October 4, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amanda Arce,Google Play Store,,
"Not reliable. Order was delayed for more than 1 hour because of app issues. Updating my review on October 2nd to say that you are really the worst. Bolt Food and Glovo are 100 times better.

This never happens with Bolt and Glovo, and I order with them almost every day.","October 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lucrezia Pirani,Google Play Store,,
"Their service fee continues to be a joke. Do not order from Uber eats. Instead use it as a menu. Boycott All companies that increase menu price and include service fee. The constant notifications about this or that is annoying. Would turn off, but then I wouldn't know about the status of an order. If I get another ad I will probably delete this predator of an app. New companies will rise from this companies failures.

"I just got robbed of €21 , the app decided my location was 100km away and made me believe Im ordering food in my area, after placing the order i cancelled it 5 seconds after i see the recept but it was already too late.

"I've been using Uber eats regularly for the past two years. Today, for the second time they made me wait 2 hours just to receive ice cold soggy food. When contacting support, after an hour of ""your food is ready, looking for a delivery person"", support told me that I would have to pay full price if I cancelled. Support on the app is basically non existent, if you're lucky you get a chat bot, otherwise you just get a ""we've received your request and are ""carefully"" reviewing it""","October 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ian Jakubek,Google Play Store,,
Was really enjoying the service but Uber has really taken advantage . The app randomly took a tip from my personal bank account without my permission when i used the app within this week from an order that was 3 weeks prior. Aswell as no one there to assist with such issues. This is unsafe and i suggest other users make themselves aware to be cautious of using this app with their personal information.

"I got scammed by a restaurant who is known to not deliver orders, I sat outside for several hours at the agreed spot just for nothing to arrive, I waited until 5am, well past the restaurants closing time just for nothing to show up, they did not pick up their phone and did not provide updates through the app even upon request. I provided Uber support with proof of me being at the location including picture evidence. I had to cancel due to it just being past 5am, I deserve my refund.","September 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martijn Klerks,Google Play Store,,

"I decided to update my 1 star review as I started using the service again after a year. They've improved a ton since last year. The drivers are quick and polite, at least in my experience, and the food is almost always correct now. Something I couldn't say last year. Whatever Uber did to fix these issues seem to have worked in my case. As always though, your milage my vary.","October 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Andrew Arce,Google Play Store,,
By far the worst food app. A couple of years ago they were on the ball but now you have to pay for everything so that your order is prioritized and then when the order eventually arrives your food is cold and the order completely wrong. I think drivers should be held accountable for not checking before they take the order. Fix the issue on the spot! I'm not going to wait a couple of days for a refund! Get it right the first time.,"September 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DanTheMan,Google Play Store,,
"I installed the app yesterday. Got veryfied, linked in my card for payments and proceeded to get my first order going.

I absolutely love this app if I don't feel to cook anything I can just order on my phone and it will come quite quickly the only problem I have with this app is the delivery fee sometimes I think it quite overwhelming with the amount you have to spend base on the delivery charges.,"October 3, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Nathan Roberts,Google Play Store,,
Always delivered and when there is an error they do what they can to correct it. Can't ask for more than that from a food delivery service. Very happy with Uber Eats and currently on a 3-month free trial of the Uber Eats premium. I would definitely get it if Uber did rides in my city but because they only have the Uber Eats business it makes the subscription only half useful. There should be a subscription for the cities where Uber doesn't offer rides and only food.,"September 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dylan Lalonde,Google Play Store,,
"It's alright. I'm an Uber One member and the small discount is okay but I never get any promotions/coupons at all.

"Horrible experience. I ordered my foor once, and the apps say that the order didn't go through. Place it again, I do that, and then I see both the orders on my home screen. Like what? Are you scamming me. Then, when I called customer service saying that I was facing this issue, they said, ""Order was placed to the merchant, we can't do anything."" Dude, if my order went through, tell me! I won't pay 2 or 3 times. I used to like the app, but now I just hate it.

"Rated 5 star in 2020, Uber one member since, and still 5 star. Had some bad experiences but majority (probably 96 out of 100) are good. Good service overall and great for parents wanting a night off cooking. They sometimes offer deals which makes it same price as pick-up.

"Appalling customer service. Refund process is flawed/restrictive. They will not refund you for anything other than the bare minimum (the exact price of any missing/damaged items) and will not refund for the inconvenience or poor experience. Zero flexibility/not willing to provide compensation. If this were another sector or business, you would be offered a goodwill gesture as an apology. Awful.

"My previous review from years back was 5 stars. Update: Far downhill from what it was. If restaurants make mistakes UberEats will blame you . Even if legitimate with evidence, even if half your order was missed and the driver and customer service agree this is what happened. Ubereats gives your money to the restaurant and refused to refund you. Restaurants have no incentive to fix problems or avoid problems.

I've only had one negative experience and that when they sent my food to another house.. clearly, the driver wasn't bothered about where I actually lived. However, I got a full refund! And customer service sorted the issue out really fast. Now, they've set up a pin code for me to tell the driver when he arrives with my food or shopping.

Ubereats is a is a big rip off you get half your order if you get it at all please don't expect a refund not happening.

The drivers are picking up and then refusing those orders and so on and my deliveries took so much time in my case, sometimes they don't even arrive and I get a message with my order being cancelled after 1 hour or more which is completely outrageous.

"The complete lack of customer service is not OK. I just got half my order and was refunded less than $3. Then if you consistently have issues, uber will caution you no matter how much documentation you can provide. The drivers picture can show no drinks and they will still give you the ""you're impacting the restaurant."" So I should pay for things I didn't get so you and McDonald's can keep profits you didn't earn? Also I've had drivers deliver to the wrong apartment multiple times.

Thankfully, he had someone in the store to help him & was able to communicate with me, but what if that's not the case?

"The main thing this app suffer from is the inability of the store to contact the customer. Because of this, orders come wrong all the time. For some reasons restaurants also dont have the ability to refund parts of orders that are unavailable, and then Customer Support refuses to provide a refund. Horrible customer service.

My order today was $40 and I paid $20 on services. If you calculate the cost on just services I paid 50% of what my food cost me.

"Did not even read my query and your help options does not cover the query i had, and it seemed like the help consultant did not read my query properly.

"Drivers get lost or register that they are on the way but half hour later they are still at the restaurant. They drive like hooligans so food arrives all smashed up. So you wait 60 to 90 minutes for a simple order. Very disappointed in decline in service level. When I first started with Uber Eats it was great, 40 minutes wait, good communication and delivered with care. Now, like everything else in South Africa you have to be satisfied with sub standard service.

Horrible company. The restaurant was out of the item i ordered. They left a note on my receipt and told my delivery driver. Uber still refused to refund. Even with proof. They'd rather lose a loyal 2 year Uber One member than refund a $10 milkshake. And this isn't the first time this has happened. Customer service hung up on me 4 times. Refused to let me speak to a supervisor. BEWARE. Canceled my Uber One membership and deleted the app. I'm filing a complaint to the Consumer Protection Bureau.,"October 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mr. Opiaticus,Google Play Store,,

Extremely disappointed by the support. During a delivery I was waiting the delivery person by the door and I saw him dropping the bag with food. He completed the order in his app without a photo that they usually take and gave the feedback that he couldn't reach us. He also said to ask for a refund as we didn't receive the order.

Ordered McDelivery and this was fulfilled by ubereats. Did not receive my order. Told by customer support that the driver had attempted to contact me multiple times so I was not entitled to a refund.

"I've had a consistent uber deliverer for a bit now and he told me that when him and his friend uber together, they'll 'switch' orders or something so he can give me my food it's borderline sweet and annoying - I just want my food, but then he does his best to make conversation with me when I gotta get back to work 💀 I use it almost everyday when I'm at work and most to all drivers have been good with keeping the food the right temperature - when it's cold or the drinks are warm, it sucks","September 13, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Destiny Ramirez,Google Play Store,,

"Total terrible. I was charged for an order that never arrived. I contacted the restaurant to see when it was picked up, and they confirmed that no one collected the order. When I tried to contact uber eats, is no support, only a message from the ""help"" informing me that if they can not deliver, you will be charged. This was my 1st encounter with Uber eats and will be my last. I organised this order on behalf of my husband, who had become ill on a business trip and was unable to drive. Useless","August 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Holly Fisher,Google Play Store,,
"This app is only as good as its couriers. I live in a complex with a security boom that requires vehicles entering to have a valid driver's and car license, two things that any law abiding citizen should be able to produce while in their vehicle. At least 40% of the time, I'm forced to drive all the way to the security entrance because the courier doesn't have a licensed vehicle or personal license. Uber fails to vet their drivers and allows their food to be delivered ILLEGALLY. Not good enough.","August 24, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ric Shields,Google Play Store,,
"Uber Eats makes it so very easy to order and add special delivery, and always stands behind credits for misdelivery or missing items or poorly made food. There aren't always ordering options I'd like but that's the fault/responsibility of the Restaurant. Uber fees are reasonable for the convenience, and they offer 'member' options if you prefer BUT they do NOT require or force you to sign up like some other food delivery services!","August 28, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Morgan,Google Play Store,,
Feedback needs to be an option on the app for customers especially for each restaurants. I wanted to post a feedback for the firehouse subs menu requesting more customization options.

"I've been using the service for a couple years now. Last week I experienced an overcharge from Chipotle. I contacted Uber Eats to rectify the manner as requested. 2 days go by, giving me this list of information they need to issue of $4 refund. As most Americans do, this is too much of a hassle to bother to get $4 back. They do this, I feel purposely to not have to issue these small refunds. Thus would go into a surplus account. I've deleted my app.","August 26, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Danelle Lucado,Google Play Store,,
"After placing an order it just dissappears. You have no way of tracking it. This caused me to duplicate my order and get charged twice.

App needs some serious improvements.","August 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brendt Wooi,Google Play Store,,
"They do not correct issues or give refunds. They make mistakes and let you pay for it. They are late and serve cold food and still make you pay full price. They have horrible communication and just ignore the chats you send and send the same message whenever you have a problem....""we complement understand however you do not qualify for a refund"".

"I can't even say I get my order right 80% if the time. I give it a try like every 3 or so months and when I have issues I report them right away. I take the picture, explained what was ordered and what I got instead, and try to figure things out. The customer service is terrible. I point blank asked twice why they won't give a refund and they thanked me for my understanding. I wouldn't have cared if it was just the app credit or something along those lines. But they don't care about quality.","August 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nakiiya Gore,Google Play Store,,
Good app when things go smooth. But terrible for refunds. I paid priority delivery and also the driver 20% and he goes to overs before me. I then cancel and have to pay half for cancelling fee.

"These guys really went downhill quick, the service is constantly delayed, changing drivers , sending someone on a bicycle who is 5 miles away. No drinks with the order, food made completely wrong and they only want to refund you a quarter of it. Their technology all of a sudden magically sucks too.

"Horrible birthday experience. Was charged for an order i canceled within seconds of submitting it incorrectly and wasnt told that it failed to cancel through the app, i was only told after i was charged via an email so i ended up ordering twice and paying twice.

"Accidentally ordered at the wrong restaurant for a pick up and the customer service I received was awful. I have one major recommendation, be able to change from pick up orders to delivery. The customer service rep I had also was trying to charge me a cancelation fee for my order? WHO would cancel an order just to get charged extra? Rep also wasn't willing to help at all and kept telling me to call the restaurant. I understand it was MY fault but they should have tried to help more.","September 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Aaron Cappello,Google Play Store,,
"Their driver dropped our food outside our house and none of it could be saved (it was raining and the food got soaked). Uber swiftly canceled our order, which was nice I guess, but we would have preferred to have it remade and redelivered. We went to order it again and now they want a $19.99 delivery fee, when before it was only $2.49. What a low blow attempt to make back their lost money. I went to order it again anyway and now it says the restaurant is too far away. Do better Uber.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Judah Romano,Google Play Store,,

"If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Uber eats has gone downhill. Customer service is a joke. If you don't receive part of your order, customer service barely responds, and you absolutely won't get a refund for the missing items. So essentially, Uber eats steals from you, the customer. And the push for uber one really isn't that worth it, the savings really aren't savings. So glad I've canceled my subscription","August 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erikka Botos,Google Play Store,,
"The help system on this app has gotten significantly worse and it's obvious that it favors the system rather than the consumer that has a legitimate claim. I had an issue with my order but was not provided with any recourse for correction whatsoever when previously I would have been.

While my order shows the correct address, the driver told me that there was a different address, so i didnt get the food. I went to the restaurant to get my food, but they said, ""you have to go thru the app"". The problem is, because I didn't order thru the app, I ORDERED THRU THE JACK IN THE BOX WEBSITE, there is no record of the order and no number to call.","September 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stacy K,Google Play Store,,

Not worth the hassle most of the time. You get local food colder and more expensive than if you ordered from them directly. Rarely worth the extra cash.

"I've almost always had a positive experience with Uber Eats, and the few times my order was either late or incorrect customer service has always given me credit back as an apology. It's a good app for ordering food, although things tend to add up a bit on the pricier side if you don't have Uber One, although just using the service twice generally pays for the subscription cost so if you use the app at least four times a month you get your money's worth.","October 11, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Mike Chamberlain,Google Play Store,,
"Drivers don't read directions properly, can drop your food off at the wrong place, as long as they take a picture of a door with the same number, the delivery is confirmed an no refunds will be given even if you never got your order. You are expected to find the door in the confirmation picture as if in some sort of easter hunt for your food. Even providing proof that the door in the picture is not yours is considered a valid reason to be given any kind of credit.

I used the 5 dollar credit on a separate order the next day, and 4 days later they have charged me for it, effectively stealing $10. Boycott the dogs and use any other service or your own feet.

It took me over two hours to receive a refund for food that was never delivered to my home.

I have been doing multiple orders since Friday and they have screwed up and canceled my orders at least half a dozen times. I waited 45 mins for an order and all they would refund was a 5$ that's it.

"Uber is to expensive in my area. The restaurants charge 20ish % extra per item. For example, it's only 15$ for butter chicken at my favorite restaurant in store. On uber its 18.99. Then there's a 15% in fees from Uber. Then, of course, tipping the driver (not tipping is a d-move) 15-20%. So, my 15$ order quickly becomes 25$. Normally, I get a few meals (40-70$), like most families. It endes up being 100-140$ everything, I need to use Uber.

"Wonderful App only with a slight UX issue I hope the developers read this message. When a restaurant offers a 1+1 deal over any product item, their restaurant name would stay forever as a restaurant offering a deal. Because of that, there is a huge traffic of restaurants with deals over a piece of bread that occupy the space and block the visibility over other restaurants with actual daily deals.

We mistakenly ordered twice from the same restaurant and cancelled duplicate order minutes after. We contacted the restaurant to prevent any misunderstanding and receive the food for one order. We process to refund incorrect order that very same day. Uber eats responsed some days later and refused to refund us citing that they already send money to the restaurant.

"The upprice makes make ordering food unaffortable. It's laughable how much the food is overcharged. The restaurant tells you this is to cover their cost to Uber, yet Uber charges service costs. You pay overpriced food(+€2,-), € 1,- to € 4,- for delivery and € 2,- to €6,- as service to Uber. Uber is know to underpay it's workers. Everybody'd like to see it change, but this is out of order and just pure greed. I know it's a recession but this has been gooing on for a while.

"Both orders took over an hour and half to arrive. Both times the rider arrived at the store, rode 2 miles away (without my food), then turned around and went back to the store, when they arrived back they were replaced by another rider who then delivered my food, cold. Was told by Uber the best they could do was give me £5 towards my next order (which I don't want). Use another app if you are hungry.","August 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe Tindall,Google Play Store,,
"I have been using this app now for around 10 month's but not anymore, I only used it for takeaway delivery. 9/10 the delivery is late the food is cold & all Uber do is refund the delivery charges every now & then?

"Customer support is trash when they are put on the spot, and their system can't keep track of how it bribes you. Nothing like going to cancel Uber's version of a premium subscription, and getting offered 90% off to keep it. Then the payment comes out and look at that, I JUST PAID FULL PRICE ANYWAYS.

"My deliveries have been extremely late (>1 hour) or not delivered at all despite being ""priority order"", having an uber pass and spending exorbitant service fees.

"Why is there no option for ""other"" when explaining a complaint about your delivery? Several times now I have had food orders ruined (particularly drink orders) because the driver put the items directly in front of my screen door.

They told me to cancel and reorder to get utensils that i needed with the order for a hotel delivery then they charged me twice. IHOP even called them to let them know that they only made the meal once but they were transferred to my phone number instead of uber eats talking to them.

App allows drivers to make multiple stops meaning your food arrives cold and old. This should be illegal as it poses a health risk.

"I like that you can pay more for priority delivery but I think it's insane that even if you don't pay the extra, you still might not even be the SECOND delivery. The drivers drop off more than two orders? How do you measure which of the ""non-priority"" orders get delivered first? Are we going to have to start paying to get ""Slightly higher, but still not the highest priority"" delivery? Or do I get a discount if I say ""nah, I don't care if my food gets cold, me last!""

"I can get all of the food I want at great prices but, as I'm an Uber Eats driver, I know that the customers are winning because sometimes the driver has to drive for a long time - sometimes all the way across the city - and all the customer has to do is wait at their house for their food and pay for it. Meanwhile, the driver has to pay for gas and other essantials for their car while Uber doesn't help with that at all. Uber also pays cheap for their drivers.

Literally all I want is a single page with all restaurants, and a rating/delivery fee. Why is this so difficult to implement? I've on multiple occasions downloaded this app only to remove it because there are no restaurants listed.","January 21, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Petter Blomkvist,Google Play Store,,

Won't let you cancel the order even though you have time right after to cancel.

There seems to be no way to minimize or remove the order summery page so I can see the map. Other than that, the only real issue I have is drivers ignoring my delivery instructions, and blocking my door with the food.

Then told could not cancel once order placed. Also, the priority means nothing, the time your order gets there could be the same as non-priority, so don't waste your money.

I tried their help, but they refused to do anything unless I could screen grab the discount code.

I absolutely cannot stand how useless the app is with assisting with ongoing orders. You cannot cancel them but that option is on the app. Can't do anything about orders that are over 2hours late but the option is there.

According to them I should've known that I was supposed to take a photo of a stinky product to prove that it has bad smell. Yep, that is ""the policy"".

"No, don't order from them. I had canceled an order right after submitting it, no time given and still got charged. They need to warn people when deciding to cancel an order or have that labeled while ordering: if you cancel and they accept your order, regardless of the time given, you will still be charged. I had to dive deep to find that out. I thought when I received the notification of it successfully being canceled, It was canceled, with no charge. They still have lots of glitches to fix.","July 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Grasie Cid,Google Play Store,,

"I’m have been a Uber Eats driver and passenger for about 4 years and I have to say that when I first started was a really good company to work for. But know this company isn’t taking care the driver the way they should. This company use are vehicles and they don’t pay for gas, insurance or any other things. They are giving more to customers than us and not only that they pretend for us to pick up order for $2.95 and you have to drive 8 or 20 miles for something like that. I believe if all the drivers get together and stop taking order this company will go down very quickly.

In essence charging me twice. Now, they refuse to credit it back. Preventing me from purchasing groceries. So it's no food for me until Uber decides to give me the money they stole from me.

It's important to note that I had chosen a no-contact delivery option when placing the order. Before the driver's arrival, I received a notification indicating his presence. I started watching him through my Ring camera. The driver exited his car and walked to the back driver's side door, quickly closing it.

I know the temp we are getting our food at are below safety standards, Uber likes to charge a additional fee to be prioritized which cause more of a issue with getting your food on time. I worked for pizzahut for many years and we never charged these outrageous service fees and what's more amazing the delivery apps are double dipping charging the restaurant and the customer and expect tips over the top.","January 1, 2022",1,James,Consumer Affairs,"New Market, MD",
"I’m not a person who complains a lot. And trust me when I say I’ve given them a lot of chances. But it seems like something is always wrong with the service and/or food. Either they can’t find my address, and honestly my address is easy to find, or items are missing, or the food is cold and/or unappetizing. And any time I’ve turned to Uber Eats for support, they just conveniently aren’t available. This time I paid for items I didn’t even receive because “no refund is available.” I tried to connect to the delivery driver and he simply didn’t pick up. So I’m stuck paying for things I can’t even eat, because I didn’t get them. More","December 18, 2021",1,Sonja,Consumer Affairs,"Murrieta, CA",
"This is the worst customer support I have ever dealt with. I have guys working out of town and do not have transportation to go get food so I have them use Uber Eats business but that was a huge mistake. To start off with they delivered the food to wrong address when there was very specific directions I left for them. Took me over an hour to get in contact with someone and then when I finally did they would not help my guys get any food, said they would refund but that’s it. Now keep in mind this is after 9 pm, they are starving working in the freezing cold all day. So they get no help from customer support, tell them to order again so they did and 20 minutes after ordering again this is after 11, get email saying they can’t deliver food, try again somewhere else and customer service still won’t help.

"Whenever these guys mess up, they place the cost on the customer, unless you go to 1000% effort, you simply lose your (almost non-existent) value for money to all types of nonsense, including but not limited: 1hr+ deliveries for simple 15 minute journeys, couriers driving past your location 4-5 times in a row before actually finally dropping food off, ice cold food/burnt food from the restaurants (*ahem* food safety please!!), food being swapped for other items without your permission and last, but worst of all - missing items (probably the worst and most common of all of the Uber Eats problem). The reason that the missing items point is the worst point is that you are literally just not compensated in any form for them not being provided.

"My Rating as a Uber Eats Delivery DriverNothing but praise to Uber Eats since commencing with them in January 2022. I gain personal satisfaction through my interactions with both customers and merchants. The Uber Eats App is excellent and easy to use from the perspective of a delivery person. Well designed and constructive in all aspects including a functional and highly effective GPS Navigation System. In my opinion Uber is far superior when compared to Menulog, Deliveroo and Doordash. Many opportunities exist to earn good money with Uber Eats, in particular, using the Boost system and regular Promotions. I encourage all persons no matter there age to join Uber Eats as a delivery partner. Uber is well deserving of a 5 Star Rating.Show details",2022-04-27T22:51:33.000Z,5,scorpio88,productreview,,My Rating as a Uber Eats Delivery Driver

Only once i have been told an order has been delivered but was never actually delivered, i immediately received a refund, when this occurred on Menulog i was interrogated and never got my money back.

"Reasonable Food Choice; Reasonable Delivery FeeSince COVID I've used Uber Eats a number of times to deliver meals. Overall, I've been quite happy with the service and my observations are:
1. Restaurant choice is good without being excessive. I've found there is a distance limit that can appear to be arbitrary. For example, I can order from Civic to my house, a distance of 6-7 kms; but not Woden which is 8 kms and still within what I consider a reasonable distance;
2. The drivers have been courteous and place the food outside. They also ring the doorbell; and
3. If you choose priority for a few dollars more, then your food is delivered as promptly as picking it up yourself.
I've had one or two items missed from the order early on, but this was rectified by the restaurant. Overall, I've been happy with the service and have used it several dozen times in the last six months. For the Canberra area, Uber Eats is a good service provided your restaurant is close by, you know what you are getting, and tick the important 'priority' box. I also tip, which goes to the driver, and that may help as well. The only thing that stops it getting five stars is the somewhat arbitrary distance limitation that seems determined by a compass rather than driving times. But definitely recommended.

"Deliver fast, but lots of hidden chargesI have three critics. First, ubereats doesn't offer all the options that your selected restaurant actually has, Second, the prices are higher than what they actual restaurants offer. For instance, Bondi burgers from Oporto is $10 but it is $11 in ubereats. Ubereats charges you for delivery so they shouldn't charge you more for the actual food. The third issue is the GST, they add GST on top of all extras, more expra price for your foid and delivery. So it starts adding up.

To make it worse, I tried to contact them a couple of times and noticed their chat was disconnected too.
It is deceiving knowing that you have to make sure no item has been removed otherwise you lose the discount just like me. There is no proof if they did it on purpose during the order preparation which means you have to pay attention to your order in case they pull this one on you.

The UBER delivery bags often are sealed with staples - on more than one occasion, a staple has fallen loose onto the floor. Some vendors & delivery services use sticky advertising tape - which can’t kill me !
Of course it’s a long shot, but if I don’t see a tiny piece of wire or staple on the floor, and it goes *inside* my skin, it can migrate into my bloodstream… you know the rest.

"No good for businessUber will take up to 40% of the order. It actually costs money to use them. Additionally drivers can take a long time to deliver and then we are blamed for the cold food and need to replace it. We only went for it due to demand, but we will be pulling out due to the costs. Great for the buyer of course, but the drivers get little and the restaurants lose money.

"RIPPED OFF and NO Recourse! Absolute Goat-Rope. Yet another business hiding behind COVID-19 for poor customer service. I was overcharged for my order, but have yet to receive a refund. I ordered and paid for two pizzas, but only got one. On top of that, the delivery arrived 35 minutes after the time UberEATS' ‘estimated' time of delivery. To make matters worse, there is ZERO customer support. No call center, no chat... nothing. If/when my refund hits, that App is going in the garbage where it belongs.
Tip for consumers:
Although DoorDash’s isn’t a gold standard service, its customer service is markedly better than UberEATS. During the instances in which there’ve been discrepancies in charges, DoorDash has done a much better job of responding to them and issuing refunds in a far more timely manner. In addition, DoorDash’s estimated times of delivery are much more accurate than Uber’s. I get the impression UberEATS just doesn’t care. They get their payment and they’re done with you.

"The absolute worst delivery service ever! I contacted the actual provider and they advised me that since Uber collected the money I had to go through them for the refund. Of course, Uber declined the refund. I'm irritated by both companies. The food delivered was undercooked and tossed in the garbage. Uber just says... no they can't offer a refund. Really? I will never use them again and I recommend you stay away too unless you want to flush your money down the toilet! Try Grubhub or Door Dash... way better service! Grubhub will be my go-to from now on.

My food was cold and soggy, but they can't refund me. Their service is horrible!

"Uber Eats Sri Lanka has very poor horible customer service. They are robbing customer packages that were paid by customer but not delivered.

"NO Phone support. TIME Consuming. Very Buggy both on app and PC... Tried many times to make the same order and this it is frustrating ""Something went wrong"". While the app suddenly decided to go through after the 5th time the app/pc version does not know what it wants... I insert payment method 50% it declines or gives errors.

The first issue I had a weeks back, ordering asian restaurant. A popup for $20 discount was offered, but when got to the end of the cart to order, it said it cant be used? So I decided just to get something locally. Why do you offer something and revert back from it, I find this practice unfair. Was told from CS they sorry to hear and its not how business should be. But there was no resolution.

Secondly. Beware when making orders. Most recently July 7 2021: Went to the 7-11 on Amsterdam ave to pick up items (the order is completed. On the uber eats receipt). I waited 30 minutes just to be told to come back in 2 more hours. I also value my time, l; im not too happy with the whole entire system and unable to communication with merchant directly either. Was not able to reach them by phone either. On top of this the whole order was not fulfilled properly and incomplete. No alternative item or communication was offered. Only ""out of stock, no replacement"" on item receipt thats it! The lost of $5 credit in this case, from the 1 time use voucher with no prior notification.

For this current order I was told to come back in 2 hours to get the order. The pc and app seem to have issues (possible bugs and or missing features) that need to be fixed by a technical team) ordering (this was a hassle just to get this order through). I asked to speak to supervisor? The biggest letdown is lack of compensation from Ubereats; so I plan to switch elsewhere

Beware when ordering, buggy on both site and pc. Little to no refunds, exchanges, or communication on incomplete orders. Use other services if problem persists. Customer service is a lackluster.

"Not that I like any of the food delivery apps as they are ripping off customers with their myriad opaque fees. However, I have found that Uber Eats is worse. Not for opaque fees so much but in the delivery process itself. Since it's an Uber driver who will be delivering the food oftentimes the driver makes at least one stop before delivering our food. Thus, it's a pain if one is in a hurry to eat and worse the food is oftentimes lukewarm when it's delivered due to their additional stops.

"Today I ordered blueberries and raspberries as well as some frozen items from Target using Uber eats. When I went to wash the raspberries there was some mold outside but mold inside most of the raspberries. I took a picture and asked customer service to either refund the money or call Target so that I could pick up some good raspberries this week. They refused both and said there was nothing they could do. So use Uber eats to shop or dine in at your own risk. Yesterday when I ordered the same two items I did not get either of them so some of their shoppers need training. Before that, a shopper brought me tuna in a paper pack instead of chicken in a can. This is in spite of having photos of the items they are shopping for. Uber eats repeatedly asked me to give the shopper today a bad rating but that would not be fair to him as the mold may not have been something he would know to look for. Now this is interesting as Uber eats has no problem asking the customer to poorly rate the shopper when that person needs to make a living. Target would reimburse Uber eats for bad product but Uber eats does not consider it worth their time and would rather have food safety issues they refuse to address and poor customer relations. Beware big tech.

I submitted a claim to UberEats with a picture showing the receipt for the order with the name ""Andrew"" and only four items purchased (my name is Jennifer and we purchased six food items). Customer Service responded two days later stating that I was not eligible for a refund because I've submitted a large number of refund requests in the past. I have literally only ever used Uber Eats to order food four times ever and have never submitted a refund request through the platform before this. When I tried to challenge it, they just kept replying standard messages that I was not eligible after reviewing their policies. $25 worth of food plus tax, delivery fee, and tip down the drain ($33 total) because the order was freezing cold and completely different than what I had ordered.

"I recently ordered a meal and cancelled it within minutes. Re ordered and got that one. After a month I got billed for both. When I complained they told me sorry after 48 hours nothing they can do. My app shows it is cancelled and I ordered from the same restaurant, so the food was not spoiled in fact went up I added more items. So in essence, they take your money, charge you later, even if your app says cancelled, and then blame the timeline. WHAT A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN! Never again go elsewhere and save your money.

"HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE WITH UBEREATS,

Its taken them a couple of days to refund an $8 promo that was running on their platform.

Their agents ended chats abruptly and gave me wrong estimates of delivery times - basically devaluing their own platform for wait times (which turned out to be accurate).

I got a $3.80 compensation in cash for waiting for more than an hour and a half for my delivery. My poor driver then informs me that they added another delivery to her route when my delivery was already late!

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! Going back to Skip.

"Never expect to get a refund from UberEats! Their customer service is useless! I ordered 6 pints of ice-cream with UberEats. They arrived already melted and slushy like milkshake; the content spilled everywhere in the bag. It is a safety issue to eat ice-cream that has already melted in the heat. The ice-cream did not come in proper packaging -- not fully sealed containers but iced drink containers with stickers to cover the huge openings on top. Also, my order did not come with a cool bag like it did last time. I talked to manager at the ice-cream shop and she agreed to fully refund me for this order through Ubereats. I got 2 messages from Ubereats the next day; they were very similar in their content and rather generic. I believe these copy-and-paste messages are used to deal with all types of customer disssatifaction. The message instructed me to express my concern in their app review (btw, I had already done twice), but even then, UberEats continued to refuse to provide any refund despite the ice-cream shop manager's consent. UberEats do not take complaint seriously and they will never take responsibility for their poor service, not even when there is a mutual agreement for refund between their business partner and customer. Their nonexistent customer service and low integrity do not deserve their expensive fee charge. I am closing my Ubereats account.

"My partner ordered UberEats while she was at work, so I was waiting outside at the mailbox for the driver. Jasmine in her black Nissan Ultima zooms right by. I'm the only one standing on a suburban street. Goes out of sight. Comes back, goes right on by. I realize there's an issue, so I point at the number on my mailbox 7421 in 3"" luminous numbers. She comes back, stops and says ""Is this 7421?"" I was astonished! I asked ""Can you honestly not see these numbers?"" The driver then threw my food on me. Uber promised to refund the cost of the meal, and send a replacement meal, but walked that back an hour later. Instead, I got no food and they charged me $8 for the privilege of being attacked. Police were involved, and incident report taken. Beware! If your Uber driver is a very large black woman named Jasmine, you're probably better off just cutting your losses and forgetting about the food. That thing is stone blind and on a steroid rage.
Tip for consumers:
Think very carefully. Uber obviously takes no responsibility for dangerous lunatics that come TO YOUR HOUSE. In the light of this agent's behavior and Uber's unwillingness to investigate, I consider business with them to be a grave security risk. If you accept the risk, be sure you are in view of a camera, and having a gun is not a bad idea.

"When placing an order at a restaurant in Houston, Texas, the system processed the delivery to Florida. I tried to change the address or cancel the order, no one helped me. And they just charged the entire amount of the order. They said it was impossible to cancel or change. And return is not possible. And for this reason, it was generally possible to place an order at a Restaurant in one state with delivery in another state, despite the fact that my location is in the state of the restaurant. This is terrible service. I asked for a connection with a manager or supervisor. I just got cut off a few times. They just ignored my requests.

"Uber Eats is awful. The driver can cancel your order for any reason they want and WHENEVER they want. A driver just cancelled our order an hour after we placed our order (originally it was supposed to get there in 40 minutes). This time the ""system was down"" and last time we ordered ""they didn't have some of the items you wanted."" So you just cancel the whole thing? Ridiculous. The customer service is garbage as they make you use a chat feature that is not compatible with certain phones. I'd say go with Doordash, they are MUCH better.

"I'm a driver. Walmart just recently joined UberEats and many times they have bulk orders of just packages that need delivered. My biggest complaint is that UberEats will send out an amount of like $27 for six packages which they estimate will take an hour and almost sixty miles. Well already that's just saving Walmart on shipping. But then when you get them finished up delivering, Walmart pays you $8. I've tried talking to customer service and they say it's just an estimate what they send you; however no one would accept a delivery of almost 60 miles and one hour for $8 and it's their own car? How is UberEats getting away with this? They refuse to pay what they offer the driver. How do you know you can actually accept a ride based on that offer if they don't have to pay you that? When is someone going to do something about the unfairness of Uber and UberEats and their drivers. Gas prices are through the roof and we are using our own cars. We are getting less than minimum wage. They've lowered payment to their drivers for restaurants even lower than DoorDash now which is $2 per order…so if a customer doesn't give a big tip they decline that order. Some customers are getting their food super cold because Uber won't offer a decent fare until it's went to many other drivers. One customer told me he had waited two hours to get his order from IHOP. It was cold of course. The price was decent for me which included a tip but them not paying me what's promised and saying it's based on mileage is BS and someone needs to call them on it. I'll be the first to join a suit against them.

"UberEATS started out as a useful service, especially during the height of the pandemic. But of late it's been nothing but a scam. Items missing from orders with no real refunds given. Cold food. Long waits. Useless customer service.

Today, while home sick, I ordered some dry goods, and drinks from a grocer. I ended up only getting the three drinks, which ended up being >$20 after fees. Nothing else. Had I known, I would have cancelled the order! But when I saw the store cancelling the other items and tried to cancel the order, I was faced with even more fees for nothing.

WITH screenshots of the receipt saying it's free, my bank account deductions, AND the promo I accepted [letter]. They send me a letter and say ""Maybe someone used your account check with them.""

"I was being lazy as usual and ordered Uber eats. I had placed a big order at my local McDonald's for my family which was almost 100.00 dollars with the delivery fee. When the delivery guy brought my food he handed me a small bag and I instantly knew this can't be right! So we opened the bag and noticed none of the food was for us and immediately made an online request for my money back. Well they sent 75of it back but I lost money and didn't have any good and wasted 2 hours of my time. This whole process was crap. Never again.

"Terrible customer service. I wanted to cancel an order almost immediately after I made it. The restaurant advised me they couldn't do it and I'd have to call Uber Eats. The agent I spoke with when I called gave me completely incorrect information about how I should proceed (which basically resulted in me being unable to cancel the order at all). I then found it almost impossible to raise a complaint about this, the app only gives you options to complain about the food or the delivery driver, neither of whom were at fault. If I had been told that what I wanted to do was not possible by the agent I spoke with due to policy of whatever - ok but to essentially lie to get me off the phone is really shocking customer service.

But immediately after sending me that message he incredibly changed the status to Delivered. I couldn't believe my eyes, but that happened. I still went outside and checked every conceivable corner just to be sure but there was no sign of the food nor the driver. He either flat out lied or made a mistake. No problem I thought, UberEats would fix the matter rather quickly being so easy to confirm that the order hadn't been delivered by simply looking into the chat history between me and the driver. But that's not what happened. UberEats responded saying that they had looked into my account (rather than the situation or the chat) and concluded that I was lying. This is outrageous! How is a company like this still in business? From now on I'm boycotting them and alerting all my friends about theirs nasty practices.

"We have tried UberEats twice now. The first time a few weeks ago me and my two friends ordered burgers. It took over 1 1/2 hours for the delivery and when the driver arrived, she handed us our bag and said ""enjoy your $20 burger"" like a snob.

Last night we attempted it once again as we order from Buffalo Wild Wings. We received notification that the driver had picked up our order but would be making another delivery first. After 1 hour 40 min we received notification our order was delivered? We were sitting in our garage with drinks and nobody EVER showed up! I was refunded for the meal but lost the tip money for the driver.

So the driver decided, nah. I ain't driving out there, kept the food, made the same tip and screwed the customer who had been waiting for nearly two hours for their meal.

Fooled once shame on them, fooled twice shame on me this time. I've never had a bad experience with DoorDash and I'm sorry I tried something different. That will NEVER happen again.

I saw the driver was at the gate, so I texted him through the app (His name was Michael) and gave him precise directions to get to my unit. I never got a response. I went outside to look for him and as I was walking outside it just said "" Order Cancelled by Driver"" No call, no return text, nothing. Just Cancelled after waiting an hour. I tried to reach out to Uber eats through the application, but I believe it was just an automated response chat as they kept texting back form responses and assuring me I was not charged for my order. No charge, well fair enough, but still no dinner after waiting an hour. NEVER will I use Uber eats again and Never will I go to Trio in Palm Springs again as long as they continue to support UBER Eats!

"I learned that Uber eats has horrible customer service skills and they do not hold up there end of policy's either. I was supposed to be refunded and they gave me the run around and now they claim it's too late, and I say that's too bad so sad horrible customer service you can't even talk to a live representative to even dispute issues. Something that should be changed in order to make sure customer get the very best of the best service.

"First time using Uber Eats and i saw a Buy 1 get 1 free Order. I put in an order and placed it. However, the website barely gave instructions that you have to put in another of the same order to get that one free. So i thought if you put one order, you get the 2nd automatically. Absolutely absurd User Experience. And the fact that i have to call to get a refund instead of clicking a button on the order section is awful and out of the times.

"Literally ruined our night last night as we ordered food around 7:30 PM and they said a driver was on the way, went through 3 drivers leaving the restaurant or just not picking up the order. I called the restaurant and another driver came and we thought it was ok, I waited outside with my pet duck for a half hour and called the restaurant back and apparently Uber eats ended up not taking our order again. We didn't get to eat until 10PM because we had to go get the food ourselves. With my health I can't stay up late so I barely could eat anything before falling asleep...

"I tried ordering 4 times and each time there was an issue.I waited over an hour on one then it just got canceled. The same night I placed two additional orders since I was starving and one was a drivers replacement which never happened and they couldnt get a driver at all on the other.

Two hours later Im chatting with customer service wanting the orders canceled.?so I said one last chance since I had their Uber cash.I placed my last order and Papa Johns cremated my food. They wouldnt accept responsibility and Uber lied saying I wouldnt be charged but I was. Now they wont respond but I am going to by reporting them. If I could leave negative marks I would.

I still have Uber cash on there and they can keep the junk. They need to be out of business!

"We ordered El Pollo Loco online through Uber Eats, because their website said the delivery fee was ""only.49""! Our food bill was $29.95, and we gave our driver $5 cash tip. The original charge on my credit card came in at $36 due to a 'service fee' but an hour later ANOTHER charge came through for $6.62 for a tip we did not authorize. Over $18 for the convenience of having them deliver? No thanks!

My food felt like it was last in line to be delivered, because I tipped less than 4 dollars. That's the only rational reason why I can think why it took over 40 minutes to deliver it.

"I live alone and order out a lot. Got the uber pass subscription to avoid the ridiculous delivery fees (sometimes 8 or 9 dollars just for the delivery fee!). So now all of a sudden, I'm getting these ridiculous service fees. It says its based on different factors like basket size and distance. So why when I order from a restaurant within 5 miles of my home and order one combo meal am I getting charged an extra 3 to 8 dollars in service fees? I mean, I get it if I'm trying to cater a 20 person party that there would be some extra fees, but just tacking on fees just to improve your bottom line isn't worth it to me. Go with doordash instead. I mean, they'll still hire any idiot with a drivers license and a 10 year old car to deliver your food, but they charge less for it. The image is literally the cost of having 2 cheeseburgers and a small order of fries. I mean, I'm happy to tip 6 or 7 bucks, but not on top of a 5 or 6 dollar fee. If this is the fee for a couple of burgers I can only imagine what a family of 4 is paying in fees. Definitely not worth it. The food is almost never hot and fresh and with the price you can almost just call a taxi service to take you through the drive thru for less.

This company is a scam!
Most of the time the order is wrong, missing half of what you wanted, cold and disgusting after waiting over an hour, or simply just never shows up.
Want to talk to a supervisor? Calling customer service? Good luck on that. Useless! NO help whatsoever! They will NOT call you back. You can put in unlimited number of complaints until your black and blue in the face, they don't listen and will still charge you. Email? Again…. Useless! They continue to repeat how sorry they are and this order isn't eligible for a refund at this time.

This is the worst service in the US. Do NOT use them. You will end up like the rest of us. Upset!
I tried DoorDash. Had another hiccup. I couldn't find my food because the driver left my food in the bushes! I complained and received a full refund. Now that's great service! DoorDash is legit!

Apparently he was dropping off several other meals on the way. This delay in our delivery made our $70 meal cold soggy and inedible. We paid our delivery fee in good faith that our meal would be delivered in reasonable time, 20 minutes is not reasonable.

"I still used uber eats cause it was convenient. Even After meals being delivered hours late, not being delivered at all, or left at the wrong place. I still used them after their gps gave drivers completely wrong directions to my house. The final straw was being charged the following charges for a meal totaling $17.01. I was charged $9.99, $2.00, $29.42,$29.50, $15.01. I was charged $85.92 for a $17.01 delivery! When I notified them of the overcharge they told me the charges were authorizations and theyd drop off. Its now well past the time frame for authorizations to drop off and all i get is they cant find the charges. Another department will contact me. As im researching these charges i find additional charges on another date. On june 20th I was overcharged $26.95 & $28.66. These charges to this day still show as pending charges. Uber eats claim these are valid. I used there service quite a bit. Id absolutely walk miles in this heat before ever using them again.
Tip for consumers:
It’d be helpful to know they have overcharged people almost $100 for a meal. It’d have been helpful to know that paying the extra for faster delivery means nothing. That they will deliver food literally hours late abd expect you to pay for it. They’ll want to guve you a credit. Honestly i said i was gonna stop using them forever ago but I continued to use them and this is what i got. Do yourself a favor use grubhub or doordash

"My son ordered food from Sonic, and one of the meals was wrong. So he canceled the order, and they allowed the cancelation to go through, but they won't refund his money. The order was canceled immediately there is no way they started preparing the food that fast. After contacting them, they refunded $25 of a $65 order. This is absolutely ridiculous. If a refund can't be given there shouldn't be an option to cancel the order.

"I've tried to use Uber eats a couple of times. Even subscribed to the Uber. One thing they are no better than they were 3 years ago. They don't respond in a timely matter and even when they do respond, you pay $65 for a crap meal which is the delivery driver's fault, not the restaurants and they give you $5. What good is that? When you try to update an older review, it doesn't let you so you have to find other ways to let people know that even after trying multiple times, they still suck

Then whilst they were processing the order they said they were out of bread( I ordered 3) and no banana. So this is where I got ripped off, they said it's below $50 so I can't get the promotion and now my bill is $58.00 plus tip with No Bread and banana.

"Uber eats is an organization of crooks. Their delivery driver dropped my food at the WRONG ADDRESS, then sent me a pic of him leaving it at the wrong address, then left no way for me to contact him during the delivery period, then I talked to 3 customer service reps who all refused to refund my money because the driver left the food in the ""pinned location"", even though I never pinned my location on any map because I manually typed my address into the delivery address, and then they hung up in my face, twice. They refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor. The fourth rep claimed a supervisor th the name of Cy was going to call me back within 24 hours but she/he did not. This situation is entirely their fault as I have had the same address typed in my Uber app for two years and they've never delivered my food to the wrong address. Furthermore, it was their gps that pinned my location in the wrong place, not me. They stole a hundred dollars from me and refuse to allow me to speak to a supervisor about refunding jay kinetic, and the reps can barely speak any English and are completely unprofessional.

"Apparently there is a limit to how many times you can complain to Uber Eats and expect a refund. I have no idea what the limit is, but it seems we've reached it. It's not like we complain over nothing either. Every time I've complained it's because I didn't get what I paid for. The restaurant forgot to put it in the bag (or put something else in the bag by mistake), the driver delivered it to the wrong house, or someone else's order was delivered by mistake.

Yesterday morning, we ordered from Timmies through Uber Eats. The driver came and dropped off someone else's order. Simple human error, right? I tried calling the driver twice and got voicemail, so I clicked ""help"" on my app, submitted a picture of the receipt on the order we received, and re-ordered. We were all hungry and I had no doubt I would get my refund later.

Hours later, I got a generic ""we're sorry, we've passed on your feedback"" e-mail. I thought it must be another human error. I tried to find another way to contact Uber about it. No phone number, so I tried facebook messenger. I sent a screenshot of the e-mail and explained the situation. They asked for more information and said they'd look into it.

Here is the response I got:
""We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Looking at your account, we've noticed that you have multiple requests for refunds and adjustments on your orders. We've also made a note about this issue and be sure that your feedback has been heard regarding this matter. We have processes in place to review this type of feedback with restaurants and the delivery drivers, so your concern hasn't gone unnoticed. We appreciate your understanding.""

A driver mistakenly dropped off a wrap and a tea (and no donuts even though they were on the receipt) instead of the 4 sandwiches, 3 drinks, chocolate croissant and donut I had ordered... and I can't get a refund. Because I have requested refunds too often. Because restaurants and drivers (and humans in general) make mistakes.

Other services are better anyways, in my opinion, Uber Eats just lures me in with their deals sometimes... Definitely won't be using it again.
Tip for consumers:
They won't give refunds if you keep asking for them, even if they keep messing up.

Then they find out the order is cancelled and says well sorry the order is cancelled and i cant pay for it and leaves leaving me with the food already prepared and money not paid. This has happened to me several times already and there is nowhere I can call to complain or get my money back for the food thats been ordered and not paid for.

And then it will just go back and forth from ""No Couriers neaby"" to ""Accepting Orders etc"" I waited over an hour and ended up having to cancel the order. On top of that there is no Customer Service by phone and it's a miracle if You even get any help within 3 hours. You get charged for almost the entire amount of the order if You canc it while it says""*Preparing"" even though You won't even get the order because of No Couriers available or the Store is closed. I will not be ordering again from that horrible app from Hell.

"Placed an order and it was marked as delivered. It was never delivered. Had my phone on me so I know that driver didn't try to call.
His name was James John in the san diego area.
So I called customer service and they did give me the refund. Bht by the time everything happened most of the restaurants were already closed and I had no food options anymore. Asked them for some credit on my account since it was a big inconvenience to me. If the lady had just said she couldn't do it, I'd be kind of okay. But she said that it wasn't possible because the UberEats company has nothing to do or can take any responsibility for their drivers. WHAT? It's a driver that carries your company name on it and you say you have no responsibility for it? Completely unreliable service. Never using ubereats again and putting up reviews in every platform I can find! Customer should find another delivery app!

"Tried first order with UberEats tonight and I learned my lesson! Will never order again. Started an order using the app; got closer to checkout and saw $73 total for $59 worth of food with no explanation of the additional charges. Went to next screen, thinking the charges would be explained and I'd be given a chance to review, but instead the order submitted. I quickly hit the 'back' key in the app to go to the previous screens. Never got a text message order confirmation, nor any email receipt, and nothing showed up in the Activity tab of the app - so I naturally assumed somehow the order had not gone through. I ordered food from another place, picked it up, came home and started eating. 30 mins later, my UberEats order arrives and I see I was charged an additional $9 tip that I did NOT AUTHORIZE. Chatted with Uber support, no luck, refused to reimburse or even refund the 8.99 service fee. Well, lesson learned -- I'll never, ever use UberEats again.

The delivery driver turned up at the wrong address despite me providing additional delivery notes on my order (I could track their location on the app). I messaged the driver with directions from where they were to my place as it was only a street away. I called them and explained it clearly also. They travelling partway to my place then turned around again. When I called to find out what was going on they told me to meet them on the main road. I was on my own with a newborn baby so said that wasn't an option and that they'd have to deliver to the address on the order. They just marked the order as complete and I never received anything or was able to get through to them again.

"So let's get into the meat of this thing. The one pro I can say is that the app has range and most places are available for delivery. Even places that are pretty far which has allowed me to try a range of different places. Now onto the cons. Even as an UBER DIAMOND member costumer service is atrocious. For one they offer no real incentives to compensate for any food issues. The most they'll do is take a charge off an order (which it has limited parameters in which they are even willing to do that). Food is damaged or cold? They basically tell you deal with it. Food late or order canceled? Oh well! Once my food was delayed then canceled altogether (place was right around the corner btw) without so much as a notice (I only knew because I was monitoring the app) THEN they expected me to start a new order again on my own. I think this is some type of manipulative corporate tactic to avoid accountability and it's honestly disgusting. They EVEN placed the order under a COMPLETELY different date BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPORT INBOX IS MARKED FOR MAY. This has to be ILLEGAL! I can't make this up. Even if you're the most loyal and frequent customer they do little to NOTHING to ensure your happiness as a consumer. ANOTHER thing is the mystery that is the ""support inbox"". You have to go through hula hoops in navigating through the app to even FIND the inbox. Then sometimes you find it and the app closes the chat (even in some circumstances in which not much time has elapsed). Uber NEEDS to invest in better customer service especially considering the amount of individuals that are loyal to the app.

"My family has been ordering from UberEats for a number of years. We started using the food delivery service out of a need after an accident that resulted in disability (surgeries, rehab, etc.). We placed orders 4 to 5 times week. Over the years a number of issues with the delivery arose. Misdelivery (food ended up at the wrong address), wrong order delivered, missing items, spoiled food (resulting food poisening), horrible quality food, misrepresentation on the menu, cold food, sketchy drivers, etc. It is always a huge downer and really..., who wants to divert their energy to complain instead of enjoying the food or forcing yourself to eat whatever slob was delivered because you are HUNGRY. Complaints were not made lightly and alway legitimate.

On December 29,2022, we ordered from a restaurant we had ordered from one time prior. This time however, the food delivered had an obvious safety issue. As soon as I opened the door to receive the order, I smelled used/dirty motor oil. The outside of the bags was greasy and so was everything inside the bags including the glass drink bottles. All food items except for the pickles and spoonfull of coleslaw and cucumber smelled like dirty motor oil. We all sampled the food and spit it out. It tasted rancid, bitter and left our mouths burning even after rinsing our mouth with water repeatedly.

Naturally I reported it both on the order and in a chat. The BOT reply was a generic 'we appologize but can't do anything for you...' I called out the bot reply and apperently a human agent replied after a number of days. I replied and had to fend of the bot again. Finally an agent replied on January the 10th and admitted that there was an issue. He advised me to contact the escalation team. I asked how because there is no phone number or email listed on their website or found in Internet searches. It took several days before I was provided with a toll free phone number. I spoke with 2 agents today and got nowhere! Apparently Uber adopts a ZERO liability policy after their cut-off of an undisclosed number of complaints. All the agents kept repeating (like bots) is that my account is under 'review'... but that a $5.00 Uber credit was applied to my account... Is that compensation for the $70+ wasted and all the aggravation? Absolutely not! One thing is clear; Uber is by no means a reputable company. I had heard similar stories over the years and should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned...

"DO NOT EVER USE UBER EATS, AND TELL EVERYONE ELSE NOT TO AS WELL!

My last experience with Uber Eats support was horrendous. On March 26,2022, I ordered from Jersey Mikes. Uber Eats had a sitewide promotion for 25.00 of a 30.00 or more delivery order. Those were the only two criteria. Food total before tax and fees must be 30.00 dollars or more, and it must be a delivery, not a pickup. (photos attached)

Imagine my surprise when the full 47.22 is taken from my bank that night, instead of 22.22. Chatting with support at first went well. They agreed that the code did not ""automagically"" apply itself and issued a 25.00 refund, as opposed to a 25.00 credit.

Color me stupid when 48 hours later, no credit has been received by my bank. Contacting Uber Eats customer chat again, I asked about status of refund. The first chatter ended the chat, no response given. I was asked by the chat bot did they solve the problem? I select no. New chat agent appears. Says they will look into it. Tells me that the credit will be back in my bank in 3 to 5 business days. Why does it take that long in the days of digital banking? Every other service I use immediately credits my payment method back any confirmed errors. Why is it ok for Uber Eats to promise a credit, reflect it on your phone display in receipt form, then keep your money when they make a mistake? I cant order and pay 3 to 5 days later, so why are they allowed to steal my money?

"I was a loyal customer and I will say this has nothing to do with the hard working people who drive for this ""Company"". Long story short... I order pizza at 10:20 PM and was estimated to get it at 10:50 PM. I understand thats a soft time because they can never be exact. They changed to delivery time 3 different times now to 11:30 PM. I contacted UberEats chat and they offered to cancel my order but offered no other information. I said yes cancel my order and then they said ""Order cancelled, you will be charged a $17 fee"". During the chat and when they offered to cancel my order they never once said anything about a fee to cancel. I contacted them again and asked to be reimbursed because they are the ones who offered to cancel but never told me about a fee before i accepted plus they are the ones who did not have a driver available to pick up the food. They stated It was well within the estimated time frame and that they would not refund me. I asked to speak to a supervisor several times to which they refused and stated they can no longer help me and ended the chat. I started another chat and was lucky enough to get the same person by the name of Deepak. I stated that was unprofessional that he ended the chat and also for refusing to let me speak to a supervisor. I provided Deepak with screen shots of the chat and it clearly showed that they never once said anything about a a fee before THEY asked me if i wanted to cancel. Then I showed them another screen shot that clearly showed that my delivery time changed 3 different times which proves it was well over the time frame window which makes them response able for taking orders when they clearly know they dont have enough drivers in the area to meet the estimated time frame of delivery. Again he refused to let me speak to a supervisor until i threatened to post all screen shot of the messages and changed time frames to social media at which point (I assume) a supervisor entered the chat and finally gave me a refund. I had to spend more than an hour trying to get a refund for a problem that was clearly created by them. I WAS a a regular customer of uber eats but I can no longer support a ""company"" that makes it difficult for a customer to get a refund for a problem that they clearly made. I hate not to support the hard working uber drivers but I just can't support the greed this place showed me today.

"Working for Uber eats is terrible compared to doordash or any other service. They have problems accepting documents And they do not care about their employees. I had to drive a few miles to the restaurant after accepting a order I made it 5 min early upon arrival time. The store was already closed so they continue to give workers the same order and then they won't ever compensate you for your time for driving especially with gas prices right now. Doordash has no problem compensating their drivers for issues like this. I will no longer work for a company who doesn't care about their employees.

"UberEats has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

They continue to mess up their deliver orders; I constantly receive the wrong order.

I have photos to prove that the order was not mine.

When I speak with their agents over chat, they provide automated messages saying that they're ""looking into a resolution"".

I went through two ""chat agents"" since they abruptly cancel chats without a resolution, and the third agent that I try to get in touch with cancels the chat before even trying to help.

They refuse to provide me with a refund, because they say that I've complained about too many orders when in fact it's THEIR FAULT for not checking to ensure that the correct order is delivered.

I finally had to call them directly to complain in order to get a refund.

I want nothing to do with Uber at this time, and will be changing both deliver and transportation services.

"I ordered food through the Uber Eat app and the rider (name Hafez Saleh) could not find the door to my apartment. I messaged him with instructions but was ignored, called him many time but couldn't hear him as the line was very bad, and suddenly got a message that the order has been delivered when it's not! When I contacted Uber Eat, they refuse to give me a refund as it was recorded as delivered. They blame me for not being attentive to the phone when I have clearly given the intructions and tried to contact the driver many times. They did not even bother to check the previous messages. I will report this incidence as a scam with my credit card and hopefully the transaction will be blocked. Its against customer rights to charge people with items they never received. For those who making orders, be very carefull as they will charge you regardless if you receive the item or not. Make sure to make screenshots of the messages as it will be deleted once the driver record it as delivered. The customer servive will not help you.

The driver left my order at some random door and sent a picture through the app (as attached), and uber eat asked me to pay for that and refused to give a refund!

"I have been a loyal Uber Eats customer for some time now. I have not used their competitors. In the past, although there were often issues with deliveries the Uber Customer Service was excellent and they were quick to rectify any problems. Not any more. Recently I have had a couple of very botched orders, both of which Uber have refused to address. Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and the reason I will no longer use Uber deliveries moving forward.
I placed an order for a food delivery from MacDonalds. Three different Uber delivery drivers accepted the order and actually travelled to the restaurant (I watched each car travel to the store via the app tracking). But each time upon arriving at the restaurant the driver cancelled the job. I have no idea what was going on there. Finally, after the third driver cancelled and my delivery time jumped forward another hour I decided to cancel. I could not wait any longer. It had already been an hour as it was. There was no driver on the job at this time. Uber then proceeded to charge me for the entire order (including ""compensation for the delivery driver"", who never did the job and wasn't currently assigned!). I rang MacDonalds directly to check what was going on. They informed me my order had been sitting on their bench for an hour and no driver had been there. So I was forced to pack my two sick kids in the car and drive to the restaurant myself. I collected my cold, soggy ""hot"" cakes and hash brown and my cold, curdled coffee and returned home. The coffee was tipped down the sink and the inedible soggy food was also disposed of. This is not MacDonalds fault. But what in earth was Uber doing? I contacted Uber to ask for a refund of my $27 and they declined telling me "". Does not meet criteria for a refund based on the information I provided"". What doesn't meet their criteria? The customer having to drive down and collect the order themselves? Or the Uber incompetency where three seperate drivers failed to collect an order which was ultimately inedible. I'm furious to pay nearly $30 for this disgusting ""service"" and this is typical of Uber's business practice of late. Hence the reason I do not recommend Uber Eats and will be using Menu Log or Door Dash from now on.

She talked with me for about 15 minutes to locate but after that she cancelled the order reporting that I changed the original location (which I never did) and Uber eats just charged me the full amount for the order stating that I changed the original delivery location which is what the driver might have reported. This is the same address I used with previous drivers and never got this problem I clearly got the hint from talking to the driver that she didn't want to come at my place because she wanted to keep the food and also make the money.

"Like many of the other reviews in here, I unfortunately had the experience of an Uber Eats driver claiming to have delivered the order, when they have not - absolutely despicable practices by some of their drivers who, when they have trouble finding the address, seem to call to say that they are reaching the address soon and to wait for them, and then never do, and Uber doing absolutely nothing to reprimate such dishonest drivers and to refund orders.

The Uber support service is also nothing more than a facade - when called, they just say to contact them by email, and then by email they simply respond with preformatted messages saying that they have no intention of doing anything about the problem.

I contacted Uber eats and they advised they will not refund me as the merchant started the order.

I responded back with my situation and Uber eats have chosen to completely ignore me, even though they were happy to advise me within 10 minutes that they are keeping my money for an order I did not agree to, or received.

Uber eats conveniently post a phone number to contact them, however when you call they advise they are not taking phone calls.

This is a massive SCAM to keep customers money and I will never support this company again. Absolutely disgusting way to treat your paying customers.

"I am absolutely blow away at the dishonesty, disingenuousnesses and intentional price gouging (borderline theft) that Uber eats is doing to their customers and consumers.

My family was up charged $16.58 for pizza which sold at the store for a fraction of the price (I even checked the Papa Gino's website to verify in Bridgewater Mass, have the pictures but cannot upload due to space limitations on the site). $49.62 total for two large cheese pizza and one large pepperoni cost me $66.20 on my Uber eats bill at the hands of this thieving company. Not to mention the $9.00 dollar service fee which is added on for who knows what real reason (I'm assuming the owner enjoys taking advantage of family's and regular working people trying to get by in life) My family and I also provided a tip to the driver.

Disappointed is an under statement to say the least, it is an absolute atrocity, and this company should be put out of business. I'm sure the better business bureau is already aware, not to mention undercover stories from reputable national news networks looking to expose this fraud. I hope those who feel the same as I will band together with proof of price gouging for a class action lawsuit.

Extremely disgusted (shame on Uber),

"I order from here way too much honestly and I should've learned my lesson awhile back, EVERY time I order they deliver to another place as well. I get I could chose "" priority"" but it's extra? Absolutely ridiculous, I had a driver deliver to another place then stop in an apartment complex for 5-6 min. I LOVE the place I ordered from and wanted to complain about the driver and simply about the fact with delivering somewhere else first it caused my food to be cold and soggy. Not the restaurant's fault at all. But of course they only give you options to complain about the restaurant. Just sick of it. Definitely my last time ordering from Uber.

"Avoid! Terrible service and attitude towards customers.
Placed an order through the UE app, restaurant accepted, took payment and then cancelled my order minutes later keeping my money.
I only realised they hadn't automatically refunded me when payment came out of my bank 2 days later.
UE bluntly informed me I was too late in letting them know, as 48 hrs had passed, so no refund would even be considered! So even though I had the cancellation notice from the restaurant they still expected me to pay for an order, which is never cheap, that I didn't receive.
I asked them how to escalate it and they advised I couldn't, I just needed to accept I wouldn't get my money back. I've now gone through PayPal to hopefully reclaim through them.
Tip for consumers:
Always pay with PayPal, Credit cards etc so you're covered by them if you need to get your money back as you'll struggle to obtain a refund off Uber Eats.

"Uber Eats continues to use a bait and switch tactic with its estimated wait times to lure customers into making an order. Then, when you place the order, the wait time significantly increases. Of course that's annoying, but when you try to cancel the order because it's going to take 20-40 minutes longer than advertised, they won't let you without a cancelation fee. The customer service rep told me they would charge me $15 to cancel a $20 order. How is this even legal? Is false advertisement and entrapment. How long until they have a huge lawsuit on their hands?

I switched to Door Dash tonight. What a difference! They were 10 minutes faster than the estimated wait time AND cheaper than Uber Eats!

"This company takes every possible scammer tactic in they could possibly think of and applies it to their customers. Lets start with some examples of how these scammers, scam their customers.

1. Fake promotions:
Ever get a push notification from uber with something like 75% off your next order or $25 off your next order ect? Of course you have! Now how many times when you clicked on that notification did you actually receive that offer? For me its never. It is simply a scam they do to get you back on the app. To convince you to just order something because your already there. Not only do they do this via push notifications they constantly spam you with similar emails. Again none of these promotions are real they are just false advertising to get you back on the app in hopes you buy something anyway.
2. Credit/Refunds:
Ever notice after complaining about an order the ""Credit"" they applied to your account never actually applied? Even if you received a notification saying it has been applied? This is no accident. They are hoping you don't notice on your next order that nothing was applied and just assume it was. This way they keep all their cash and you made another order through the app thinking you were getting a discount for them screwing something up.
3. ""Customer Support""
Lets say they screw something up that is worth more than $5 or there is some issue you have that requires human interaction. Good luck finding the right combination of options to actually chat with a person and if somehow you manager to get into a chat your still not going to reach a human being. What happens is they always have a line of 10+ people you wait in the que for 20-30 minutes then they tell you sorry they couldn't reach you in time we'll contact you via email. There is no option to opt out no way to continue waiting. This happens every single time. So essentially their chat system is a glorified email ticket system except you have to wait 20-30 minutes to submit the ticket. What about a 1800 number you ask? Oh they have one, And it tells you they don't offer phone support and tells you to use the app. So in other words completely worthless.
4. Jacking up the prices:
They jack up the prices on everything in addition to their insane fees. You'd think the $5+ in fees and $5+ tip would be the end of the money you are charged to order through these scammers but you'd be wrong. All menu item prices are drastically increased. Seriously Look at the uber prices and compare at the actual restaurant. A $2 sandwich becomes a $3.20 Sandwich ect

There is no phone number to call that will allow me to speak with a human to resolve this. I am canceling my Uber One and going to another restaurant delivery service.

"UberEats' Customer ""Service"" department must be trained to lie and stall and delay and fabricate excuses. Because that's what they do. Not just inept, which can happen with Customer Service, but them actually lying through their teeth. You cannot trust them. They spout a barrage of scripted excuses that don't even align with each other (refund 'delayed' a month due to ""an outage"", then ""tech issues"", THEN they say their ""special escalation team"" is ""looking into the refund"" to ""resolve""). And even when you simply have a question you want answered, not an order issue or problem but just seeking some basic information about a promo or whatever, their replies are a bottomless pit of them not even reading the question and just punching some automated reply that has nothing to do with the question at all. So UberEats is not worth it. None of the delivery services are perfect but at least the others I've used don't seem to be raging liars and thieves, as Uber Eats support is trained to be. Stay away from UberEats if you value your peace of mind; their Customer ""Service"" (""Support"") is a hellhole of stupidity and lies. (Doordash has been pretty good so far, some slight customer service ineptness one time but at least they're not outright cheating their customers as UberEats does on the regular).

"Uber used to be a an asset, not a liability (blessing not a curse). These days … wow! Out of the past 7 orders … they have cheated me, lied, didn't deliver, but made certain to charge me — then had the audacity to tell me that my delivery was not eligible for refund. Suck it up. I have had the fight to have any type of compensation.

Today, I tried redeeming their offer of a 75% off Uber cash. Once again, I am being lied to, treated out of my order. If I could sue Uber over the frustration, anger, loss of many dollars, and time, I would. Today, Mark, the end of my relationship with Uber. Even if you had the best luck in the world, you would not be able to engage them directly.

"I bought Microsoft 365, and with it I got 6-months of free delivery and a $20 credit from Uber Eats. I installed the app. The first time I tried to use it, I got a message saying my payment method was invalid. I tried 3 different cards (all with plenty of money), and I got the same message each time. I figured something was wrong with the app and used GrubHub instead. A week later, I tried Uber Eats again and got the same message. I emailed support to find out if the problem could be corrected, but instead I got a message saying my account was restricted because I was not complying with Uber's terms and conditions. I emailed back and asked how that was possible given that all I did was try to order food through the app. I got another message back saying that a review showed ""irregular activities"" on my account and that Uber has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud. Apparently, attempting to order food from a restaurant on their platform with my bank card is suspicious. Btw, based on the language in the emails, I am guessing I am getting automated responses. What the heck? My initial email says that my account is restricted until further notice. I wonder if that restriction will lift when my free delivery period is up!

Never mind, Uber. I've survived this long without you, and (other than the frustration) it's no skin off my back. You, however, have lost what would have been an excellent customer. Oh, and your app continues to send me messages to encourage me to use my $20 credit. Really?!?!

"At first, I had a few minor issues with my orders and let Uber Eats know about it. Never asked for a refund or anything back, just wanted to let them know the issues so they could improve. Because they willingly, without me asking, gave me refunds for no reason, I am now dealing with needing a refund and being refused to get one because THEY chose to give refunds over minor things. I ordered from Moe's in Spartanburg, SC and received the wrong order. The receipts I had showed someone else's name and order. The restaurant blamed the delivery driver for picking up the wrong order from the restaurant and Uber Eats refused to do anything about it. The wrong order that I received cost half of the order that I placed and paid for. My child was also allergic to ingredients in the order I received, but again, nothing could be done. Thank God I am very observant when it comes to our food and check it before anyone eats it. This company doesn't care about their customers. They do not care when an order is wrong. They do not care that the wrong order could have harmed someone, even a child, physically. They do not care that you paid extra and received the wrong order. They will not do anything about it. This company SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.

"It's very frustrating reading reviews saying uber is terrible and their drivers are thieves and orders take hours to get there.
First and foremost you can't put all drivers into a thief category. I personally never have and never will still someone's food. And for it taking so long to get there, ok but where do you live? How far are they driving? I deliver around Austin and sometimes i get an order 20 miles outside of town, well by the time I fight traffic then drive all that way it's 40 minutes. Ok well I just got paid $5.00 by uber to drive 40 minutes after how ever long it took me to get to whatever restaurant to pick it up. Then you ordered ice cream or a shake and guess what happens in 100 degree weather? It's now melted and your food is not as hot as it should be. So now you tip a dollar or even two because you're pissed that you ordered so far away and you give the driver a thumbs down because of something that's ultimately just as much your fault as ubers. So the driver now is losing money because once they start getting thumbs down they start losing money through uber. So why is uber service so bad you ask? Because you all have made it this way. These people don't make it on what uber pays. They make it on your tips so the good drivers leave and go deliver for someone else where they get better tips. Trust me these drivers aren't drivers around with your food in your car they're trying to get rid of it and get on another delivery. So there for if you have a time problem with uber that's exactly what it is with uber not the driver! Whatever though keep on big spending and tipping your $1.00 and wonder why your drivers suck. Um because you get what you pay for and what you've all built. How about give the actual good drivers like me I might add some praise instead of bashing all of us! Oh and by the way keep your $1.00 tip and give a thumbs up it costs you nothing and I don't lose money or even possibly lose my driving privileges

"I stopped using Ubereats months ago because even though we were using them 4+ times per week all Quarantine, we started getting food 30-60minutes LATER than expected. Regularly. OR Ubereats cancelled the order for no reason without telling us, until my kids were starving…never apologizing or giving refunds. Infact, TONIGHT we got a ""Ubereats cancelled your order, no refund because it was too late"".?! How can it be too late for a refund if I didn't cancel? Then I realized they SHADILY did this so I couldn't leave a review. We only used Ubereats because I got a 40% off email. I ordered TGIFridays. It took over an hour, Ubereats had apparently ""cancelled"" our order, but still charged us AND still sent the food? The food was over cooked yet still stone cold? My steak was supposed to be medium, it was Over well. Everything else was cold and our drinks had clearly been spilled as the small cups were only about 25% full at most. So shady. I will never be fooled again. Back to Doordash. Ubereats has clearly figured out a way around good quality and service…you can't even complain on their site if they pretend to ""cancel"" you, while still charging you. SHADY

I placed an order for pizza, saw that my order was picked up and on its way, then all of a sudden it was canceled. Driver said that I canceled it, but that is a lie. He picked up my pizza, then canceled my order and kept the free food for himself. I tried to contact him but his voicemail was full (go figure) so I sent him a text asking about my order to which he replied ""umm... I think you have the wrong number lady!"" Well, he wouldn't know my gender had he not actually been my delivery person, so no, I did not have the wrong number. I contacted the restaurant to let them know that Uber Eats is stealing from them, and ruining experiences for their customers.

"I have had several aspects of order or COMPLETE orders costing $50-70 that have not been delivered since pandemic began. When this happens, support at uber BELIEVES THE PAYING CUSTOMER LESS. If one driver steals your food, you will not easily be believed or refunded and they will tell you it is because you have requested a refund and price adjustment BEFORE. Um, yes, because you are all incompetent, greedy THIEVES! How is that my problem? I trusted them with my money and they did not deliver (literally) and they have the audacity to be this huge, rich corporation literally STEALING MONEY from hardworking people. Both times my entire order was stolen, uber could have EASILY made one phone call to discover the issue was not with me and valid issues. One time was a driver who lied about being bike delivery on the platform, I was their second order, and I screenshotted the GPS on the app showing the ""biker"" going 10 miles away on the expressway in the OPPOSITE direction. I also tried calling the ""driver"" and it was a number from a disconnected ""Text Now"" texting app. Total scam partner and if uber didn't believe me, totally fine, it took ONE PHONE CALL or ONE MINUTE reviewing the partner's GPS/location in the app-they were NEVER even near my address. I was out $70 no refund because I had been stolen from before using their shady app where anyone can just sign up with a FAKE NUMBER and steal food and CUSTOMER must pay to support this scam artist?! SHAME ON UBER, A MULTI MILLION COMPANY. Uber is a company worth nearly $70 billion and they cannot even be bothered to spend less than five minutes looking into why a hard working therapist, who has been a loyal customer for over 10 years, was STOLEN FROM? Tried them again last night, and I knew there would be an issue when the app claimed yet another scam artist delivery partner (also a biker who arrived in a vehicle and had horrifying ratings from other hard-working, PAYING, LOYAL customers. Said the ""biker"" tried to call me, which she of course never did, so I immediately tried calling, messaging, and finding her and my order, and of course screenshotting EVERYTHING since uber has already called me a liar. Well, I ordered $50 worth of food and received about $13 of it. The bag was tampered with. I sent uber pictures, screenshots, EVERYTHING. I even called the restaurant, who knew what had occurred, admitted fault, AND TRIED TO CONTACT UBER TO RESOLVE AND FIX IT. The restaurant could not reach uber to resolve and offered to provide me with a free meal. I have filled out every uber form, called EVERY number, and spoken with the GM of the restaurant, and they refuse to refund me via uber app and have STOLEN MONEY FROM ME YET AGAIN. They refuse to believe you if you have had a problem with missing items or missing orders before. They don't vet these thieves. Uber support is a joke and Uber is a corporation who is worth nearly $70 billion and steals from hard-working therapists and loses years-long paying loyal customers over less than $100. In both theft situations, uber could have made ONE phone call and gotten to the bottom of it in both cases. Instead of spending 30 seconds making ONE phone call, they decided to call me a liar repeatedly and refuse to refund me less than $100 and just look into the issues. The customer service is abhorrent, as is the entire greedy disgusting company. I deleted the app after 17 hours of trying to get ANYONE to help and support me and force them to look into it. I am a paying, loyal customer and have been for many years--I will NEVER give uber my money and neither will my family. I will only use grubhub, doordash, postmates, and lyft now. All of those companies can thank the disgusting customer service employees at Uber.

"My order came later because the delivery time changed once. My first driver when close to the restaurant, drove away and drove further into another city. THEY cancelled. As frustrated as I was now the time getting closer and closer to the delivery time, I tried to cancel the order and it said the cancel fee was $18. Called the help number then by the time I was going to cancel another driver picked up the order and was on its way. Uber still ended up giving me $4 back for a $30 order.

Now my food is cold and it is stale at that. Doesn't make it any better than the delivery service was very unprofessional, not punctual and there was no communication between the drivers and I.

Was NOT the first time the first DRIVER who CHOOSE to TAKE ON the order cancelled and drove around aimlessly.

Not only is it unacceptable that I as a customer has to go through this - the second driver always magically appears to deliver the food just a minute before the delivery time. So in that way I still got what I wanted? Yet the other time this happened to me a few weeks ago, the driver kept switching and cancelling AND the delivery time kept getting pushed back and even more and more delayed.

First driver might as well drive along the whole country.

"Completley disgusted, I received a coupon for $25 off my first order so I decided to try Uber Eats. I received a call 25 minutes which went into my VM saying they cancelled my order & gave me no reason why. I then went to my bank account & noticed they charged me still for the amount minus the delivery tip i left? Is this what happens when have a coupon & you dont want to honor it. This is disgusting that Uber Eats would cancel my order with no reason givin then take my money> this is disgusting to say the least & I am left with no lunch today. So Uber Eats is a scam as far as Im concerned, dont believe in any BS emails you received with coupons. I truly believe this was canceled because whoever didnt want to honor the credit that was offered. I never received confirmation either, even 20 minutes after i ordered, just the cancellation VM left where my phone did not even ring for me to answer the call. All the while the page i was on said Michael is picking up my order at the restaurant, it kept tracking all the way until i contacted them about the VM. THEN everything disappeared- the entire order but they were able to keep my cc info on file. DISGUSTING! I have contacted the BBB & my bank for unauthorized charges. I did not authorize you to cancel my order then charge me for nothing! Your customer service is pathetic!
Tip for consumers:
Dont trust Uber Eats & especially don't trust emails with coupons or deductions to your meals. They dont honor them. They will cancel your order & give no reason then charge you anyways!

"I shared the following Google review with a restaurant---YUP DDUK LA in Koreatown Los Angeles---that uses the unreliable delivery service, Postmates (who apparently merged with Ubereats):

""About 2 Hours Later: Food Wasn't Delivered, Unhelpful Customer Service, But Credit Card Charged.""

This is the title of the following 1 star, negative review I shared via Sitejabber (about Postmates/Ubereats, this restaurant's delivery folks, who already have a 1 star rating via both: Sitejabber for 713 Postmates reviews, and Trustpilot for 2,800 Postmates reviews + 25,000 plus UberEATS reviews):

YUP DDUK LA [...] is only a 2 minute drive from my hotel. However, since [...], I decided to order delivery.

Almost two hours later, I received a call from a guy stating that he had arrived at my hotel; so I told him I'll be right there, and rushed down.

I went outside the hotel and checked out several cars parked in front of the hotel---and even asked a few people in their vehicles if they were Uber drivers (but they weren't).

I then called the unknown, Uber guy's phone number back, but an automated message said that I wasn't able to complete the call.

I then looked around the hotel parking lot and nearby areas, but didn't see anyone there either.

So I returned to my hotel room and contacted Postmates, and spoke with Jay (with an Indian accent).

He asked, so I gave him the very long, order confirmation number (that I took a screenshot of, thankfully, among other proof of purchase, to include the last four of my credit card number that I used for this order).

But after putting me on hold for a minute or so, and talking to his Supervisor, Jay then told me that they had recently merged with Ubereats, hence, I needed to contact them.

However, my attempt to contact Ubereats was unsuccessful since 1) an automated message stated that they don't take phone calls now, and 2) since they suggested I receive help via an Ubereats account, I created one, only to find out that they have no record of my order (though Jay from Postmates said that they merged, and for me to contact Ubereats).

What a vicious circle this is!

I then contacted the restaurant (mentioned above), but this snappy, unhelpful, young woman stated that there was no order placed under my full name and/or my phone number.

She also added that they're not responsible for what their delivery people do (i. E., there's a blue tab that you click on titled, ""ORDER DELIVERY"" by Postmates, right below the business name, YUP DDUK LA, and their Google reviews).

Later tonight (6/4/2021), I received a 'no reply' email from Postmates apologizing for overcharging me (and that it would be corrected), and then stating that my order was successfully delivered.

But of course, since I haven't been able to contact Ubereats---the goto customer service now according to Postmates---I wasn't able to inform them that I didn't receive my order.

I called my credit card bank to block the charge from them; but they have to wait until the pending turns into a post in order to dispute.

I wonder if both Postmates and Ubereats are completely aware of this, and using this to their advantage.

I also wondered how many other Souls they screwed over; and sure enough, I came upon online sites such as Sitejabber [AND Trustpilot], that reveals the truth of the many.

Well, if this is the type of non-beneficial, negative, fear-based energy that these companies want to dish out, I have no doubt that humanity in general will become a COLLECTIVE WITNESS to their INEVITABLE DOWNFALL in Divine perfect timing and order, along with ALL other questionable, shady, dishonest, deceptive, misleading, and/or corrupt companies who mistakenly think they're so clever at taking advantage of others, not realizing at a profound Soul level, that ALL of Life throughout this world and beyond is energetically interconnected.

Tip for consumers:

There seems to be an abundance of collective proof from many people [one example: a 1 star rating via Sitejabber for 713 reviews] that Postmates [delivery service] are not trustworthy, reliable, [and] professional, AND they're not willing to take responsibility for very poor service.
Tip for consumers:
Let's be wise and discerning, and do our best NOT to fall for such companies who have had a long, pattern of NOT being honest, professional, reliable, responsible, and trustworthy.

"8:56am - Place Uber Eats Order, charged $80.98.

8:58am - Receive notification of cancelled order due to restaurant closed and I will receive a refund for the $80.98 in 3-5 business days.

9:00am - Place a new Uber Eats order, charged $79.47 with ETA no later than 10:20am.

10:10am - Check my phone to see status of order and it shows delivered at 9:55am. I check my front porch and there is nothing there.

10:20am - I contact an Uber rep via the help chat to see where my order is. After another 10 minutes of waiting I am advised that they could not get in touch with the driver to find out what happened but they will issue a refund for the $79.47 to be received in 3-5 days.

I now have $160.45 in charges that I am waiting for refunds on and running low on spending funds until payday tomorrow. I ask the rep if he can not issue the $79.47 refund and instead just get my food re-ordered and delivered. He advises me he cannot and if I want my food, I have to place and pay for yet another order and wait at least another hour. I explain that I do not have the funds in my account since I am waiting for $160.45 in refunds but he advises he cannot do anything and abruptly ends the chat at 10:43am.

10:45am - My husband begins to contact some neighbors who were doing some gardening outside to see if they may have seen any Uber deliveries or other activity to help us solve this issue. After a few discussions with other neighbors, it is discovered that a neighbor three doors down received our order. That neighbor contacted Uber to find out about the mysterious order and why they got it and they asked if it might belong to another neighbor. The Uber contact they spoke to said that it was an error and that they could have it if they wanted it or just throw it away. They said if anyone in the neighborhood reports a missing order, they would just replace and re-deliver it. So our neighbors proceeded to eat the order.

10:56am - I attempt to contact Uber help again to give them this newly discovered feedback and I receive an auto response that since I have already been issued a refund for my order, that I can no longer contact them regarding this order issue.

Now 2 hours later, I have no order, no refund for 3-5 days, no re-order from Uber as they advised my neighbor, and no ability to re-order myself since I do not have enough spending funds in my account as I wait for $160.45 to be refunded.

And to top things off, I have no way to contact Uber to give them this disappointing feedback as they are not taking support calls at this time and they refer you only to their Help section of the app where they proceed to tell you they can't help you since you've already received a refund...

"First issue...I went on Uber Eats to order from Chipotle, I saw what the total would be (expensive) so I never completed it and closed the page. I then placed an order for Taco Bell it hadn't showed up so I called the driver/deliverer he said that he was not my driver. I searched for a # to call (impossible) I finally found the option for help and reported that I had not received my order. They replied by sending a picture of where they dropped off my food, behind my house! It had been sitting out there in the rain for 40 mins because I never even received a message that it was dropped off... So...on top of it being wet and cold the order was wrong. I called Taco Bell and they said I had to take it up with Uber Eats...Uber Eats messaged me back and said to write a review on Taco Bell's website. Then I decided to use Door Dash and ordered from Chipotle even tho they were more expensive, they delivered the food no problems but I noticed another wet bag of food from Chipotle that Uber Eats left (The order that I never actually placed) I ended up spending $80 for one burrito bowl that door dash delivered. Uber Eats said that I was not due a refund since the food was dropped off at the right address...even tho they left it behind my house in the rain and never notified me it was dropped off.

"BEWARE UBEREATS IS A SCAM! I ordered food from a restaurant ""Mexican Grille"" on Ubereats at 11:38pm. It was to arrive within 60-80mins, however, after waiting for 110mins, i tried to contact the restaurant, only to find on google that the restaurant had been closed the whole time. No food was delivered, yet i was CHARGED BY UBER EATS FOR A MEAL NOT DELIVERED. I thereafter sent multiple messages to ubereat, no response, no refund. Tried calling them, phone lines are only available to ongoing orders. It's now been some days, still no response. What becomes immediately obvious is that

1)In comparison to deliveroo which offers swift support to its customers, Ubereats does not care about you beyond getting you to part with your money. It has an unreliable customer service when you do have issues. And surely having an order related issue is only a matter of time.

2)Mexican Grille is not even available in my town. Yet Ubereats listed the restaurant as if it was in my region and allowed customers to place orders, only for us to not receive any meals, yet be charged. They are running a scam model here.

3) Save your money, Ubereats is poor in doing its due diligence, has unresponsive customer service to address ongoing disputes. Supposedly listed a restaurant, yet was unaware that its phone lines do not even work. As a customer save your hard earned money, if you lose it, you will have only yourself to blame like me.

I am so used to Deliveroo's (another food delivery company) reliable customer service, this is a shame on Ubereats.

P. s-It's been two days later, no customer service response to my complaints, no meal delivered and no refund. BEWARE EVERYONE OF UBER EATS it could be you tomorrow.

"Simply not worth it. I continuously get bad food, missed items, or bad delivery drivers. Recently I had a HORRIBLE order that I asked for a refund on. It was burnt, the food was cold, my burger was somehow watery, and I ended up throwing it away. I waited an hour. They refused a refund, and gave me the same automated response. Delivery fees are also very high. Use Grubhub or Doordash. Uber Eats is not worth all of the headaches just to order food.

"Compared to Grubhub at least grubhub is on time majority of all orders/deliveries. UberEats has never once delivered any of my orders on time and it was averaged 40-50 mins late for FAST FOOD orders. Yet the locations are also no further than 2 miles or less each and regardless where I order whether it be fast food, restaurant, or high end places, it is never on time. The Customer service representatives all use that cheap $#*! psychological deterence method by oh we will not or cannot compensate you nor give any coupons but will make note of it in the system, we take our customer feedbacks seriously.

So far, things have been okay with them- but holy crap their customer service is full of morons.
I asked a simple website question- where is the option to choose tip amount?- because I had placed an order, wasn't given the option to input tip, and then charged and extra $10 on a $22 order.
They said they couldn't help me without logging into the email associated with the account. I just want to know if we can pick tips or if they changed that, and they will NOT answer me. The fact they can't answer a simple question is beyond ridiculous, especially one that involves more money for them. Shady as hell, the company sucks.

"Ordered aome Italian, received the pizza which I couldn't eat, almost got sick, called the restaurant and explained the issue. They offered a full refund and said will notify ubereats about having me reimbursed.
Few weeks later I go and check my bank acc balance, no refund appears. I email the restaurant again, they call me claiming they askes ubereats to refund on the day of the order. I send ubereats a long message with all the dates/detailed info. They reply claiming no such request was ever made by the restaurant, nor will they refund me because that's against the policy (!?). I send them a screenshot of an email fr the restaurant owner/manager where he clearly states he is happy to refund me, howevee ubereats claim they will not, constantly mentioning their policy. I sent over FIFTEEN messages basically repeating myself like a damn parrot, re explaining everything. I asked ubeats which part of their policy allows them to charge me for food I didn't even eat, have a restaurant approve the refund and them still won't giving my money back. No reasonable explanation was ever given, nor did I see my money back.

They stole it as far as I'm concerned!

I then go and google ubeats reviews and discover how many people they've robbed. I'm attaching a tiny percentage of thise reviews.

Their so called customer service is full of high school drop outs, which is great to see that even those types manage to get a job, however having to read their idiotic emails full of excuses and general BS makes me want to throw my phone at a wall. They take people's money and won't refund them even when the driver decides to not show up and claim whoever ordered the food never opened the door! I even found comments left my ubereats drivers bragging about how they get fes up with not receiving tips and keep the food for themselves especially on a nice sunny day from a good restaurant.

"Firstly I just want to highlight that McDonald's has a policy to not deliver to or near schools and the driver is expected by McDonald's to cancel the delivery by choosing ""other"" followed by leaving a custom note to which the option to leave a custom note doesn't appear for to leave one as it did on the old version of the driver app. For on the older version of the app there was an option to either put in a custom note stating it as a ""failed delivery"" but how is a driver supposed to put in a custom note stating it as a ""school delivery"" when the option to do so isn't available to the driver to put in? On the other hand when a driver is looking after customer satisfaction by cancelling orders on the door steps of any customer of McDonald's over the beverage that comes in a paper cup that spills during transport from an outlet to the customers front door. Partially or at times totally spoiling the entire order that the customer ordered. It's only right that the customer shouldn't have to be paying for it. The driver then gets threatened with dismissal for misuse of the service. This brings in disrepute of the policy McDonald's has in place to expect drivers to not deliver too or near schools by cancelling the order as doing so will also be looked upon by Uber Eats as being in breach of use of service of the Uber driver app and looked upon by Uber Eats as being in breach of the use of service of the Uber driver app which will see the driver unfairly dismissed from carrying on delivering for Uber Eats!

The same applies when accepting a ping, it doesn't state what restaurant the driver is being pinged to go too until it is actually accepted. If it is too far away for the driver to go to depending where any driver is at when receiving a ping to pick up from somewhere that is too far for the driver to go to. Cancelling that and choosing the pre-laid out options as it being too far away to travel too, will also be looked upon by Uber Eats as misuse of the driver app. And again, the threats come rolling out onto the driver of dismissal.

Secondly, I tried to update my uber driver profile by uploading an updated document of my photographic ID The photographic ID I tried to upload twice is that of an electoral ID card but twice they have rejected it. It clearly states on what documents Uber accepts as photographic ID. Being a passport- Driving Licence (from any country)- EU Citizen/Identity Card (OR OTHER PHOTO ID) An electoral ID card falls under that category as (other photo ID) An electoral ID card I can tell you is the next best thing to providing a valid passport. An electoral ID card is an acceptable form of ID when opening a bank account, buying alcohol, proof of identity in claiming unemployment benefit, proof of identity when showing it to a police officer and so on, and most definitely proof of identity in order to vote and that no one is able to vote in the general and local elections without having one. As having an electoral ID card means that anyone who is carrying such a card is in fact registered within the local government database to be eligible to vote in the local and general elections. An electoral ID card is also one of the few identity documents accepted by Deliveroo As with Just Eat and the third party background check Just Eat uses to carry out a background check before taking on delivery drivers which to me I find it really weird as to why Uber Eats as I know of has no problems in rejecting it. I have asked why but all I got was a response of copy and pasted text telling me what I don't already know of what documents are accepted.

I was informed via the app that the order was complete, however there had been no sign of anyone.Trying to reach Uber eats is nearly impossible and after multiple attempts, I called the restaurant to be told that the food had been collected some 20/30 minutes prior and their system was marked as delivered. I ended up reordering the food and going to the restaurant to collect it myself, expecting to get a refund for the order and the tip I have given in advance. Finally I've got a response to my multiple emails telling me that they've looked into the complaint and they can see that the delivery partner tried to deliver and waited 7 minutes. I explained that no one attended the property as we have a ring doorbell and no one tried to contact me on my mobile as I have no missed calls and that they must be mistaken, after several emails back and forth with me offering evidence that no one attempted to deliver or call along with proof that I attended and collected the same order, they have now ceased communicating with me with no plans to reimbursement money I spent.

Of course there is no contact number or chat options on the screen so had to search and finally called them. The person, after leaving me on hold for a few minutes returns and say that the driver lost the order. He wasn't able to elaborate further when I asked what does that mean. Then he said ""Sorry for the inconvenience and offered to refund the cost for the order"" Really. Is that how you apologize for the inconvenient. I guess it is my fault to have UberEats do this same thing to me more than once. NEVER AGAIN. They DONT DESERVE THE BUSINESS.

Ended up complaining on their Facebook page as couldn't complain on their app & there is no phone number to call them. Will not be using this service again & will not be recommending this service to anyone. Disgusting Uber Eats.

I placed my first ever uber food order. The order was delivered at the last minute and he insisted that I had a code to receive this delivery.

"Someone else's order was delivered to me instead of mine (photos show I received Bonchon yet I ordered Hawkers), yet they refuse to refund even though I have proof via my photos as well as the photo that their own (Uber) driver provided when leaving the food, showing the name of the restaurant and I have the receipt photo showing the other customer's name. They say because I had ""significant"" refunds. Those ""significant"" refunds were for my previous TWO orders which had to be refunded because of their or the restaurant's mess up, in all my history between Uber and Postmates. Those orders deserved a refund, and this one most certainly does since I never received my food that I ordered and have UNDENIABLE proof I received the wrong order. It isn't even a refund to my bank account I'm asking for. I'm asking for the credit I had on my account back that I used since the last time they messed up. I will be reviewing this (under Postmates and Uber Eats) on every site, contacting their legal team, and my own lawyer, since as I told them - I don't care if it was a small amount - I believe in consumer protections and they are committing fraud by using some hack refund/community policy and not rightfully refunding customers who show proof they are owed a refund.

"I've never been so repulsed by a company in the way they handle customer service issues in my entire life. Every single time you speak to a support rep, they're transferring you abruptly in the middle of conversations and completely glossing over my explanations like robots giving responses in uniform. It truly does not feel like out of the last 5-10 times I've spoken with somebody (or something) over there who provides online support that I am speaking to a human. Everything is brushed off like nothing and chats are ended before I can even begin typing anything back to them. If that is going to be the only line of communication to Uber eats when assistance is required then it would be nice if they could actually help in any form whatsoever. It always feels like talking to a brick wall and I've never been so stressed out by the practices which I've continuously experienced with the Uber support team so I will not be interested in doing any further business with this God forsaken company.

"They keep sending me emails with a promo, let me pick my food, add it to my cart, apply the promo, then I pay and it says they cant apply the promo I picked even though it shows as available. Then they almost immediately send me another email saying dont lose your promo, so I do it all again, only to have the same thing happen. I think it's a scam so people will take the time and effort to order the food and anticipate it, then at the last minute, the promo fails, so they'll order it anyway at full price. So disappointing they keep luring me in with the promise of a discount. Which They automatically apply- then say it's no good. I have complained before via chat and they basically were like sorry, not sorry. You'd think I'd learn, but I keep getting sucked in by their emails saying 'hurry- don't lose this deal'.

"Don't believe their Uber Eats promos. For the first time, I used them to order groceries with a $30.00 promo. Turns out that 1) prices levied were higher than those quoted on the app; and their ""fees"" totally negated any promo, so my total charge was more than the price of the groceries, as if there was no ""promo"" at all!

"An hour after my order was delivered, Uber charged an addition $9 to my total! They wrote that it was for driver tip but the driver tip was already included in my original total. What I noticed is that they subsequently changed the delivery fee on the invoice from $. 99 to $7.99. I am absolutely positive that they pulled a fast one here. I've tried for 1 1/2 hours to contact Uber but I've had major trouble getting anyone in customer service (whether by phone or online... by they way, they don't accept phone calls... you have to send messages through their app/website) but I'm having no luck. After this, I will never order from Uber eats ever again.
Tip for consumers:
Be careful because if something goes wrong with your order, customer service is impossible to get through to. They added an additional charge, that I did not approve, an hour after delivery and I can't get anyone's attention at Uber. I just submitted a claim to paypal.

"On April 24 I ordered like a bunch of taco bell, and I noticed my Fiesta potatoes weren't there. So I requested a refund and got like a $2 credit. But THEN, I looked through the rest and other items were missing or completely different things from what I asked for. Wrong meats, drink was 2 sizes too small, etc. So I went back in to request another refund, but because I had done that they wouldn't let me do another. So I called, got the money refunded, all is well. Then a week later I go to order lunch or something and my account is frozen? It says I owe 30 something dollars, which happened to be the amount they refunded me. I called and they said a team would be investigating the issue. Fast forward to tonight and no one has contacted me, so I messaged them. They are now telling me that the extra charge is LEGITIMATE and they're asking me to pay it or I can't use my account.
I am absolutely livid, and will be using Door Dash from here on out. I didn't get the food I paid for and now they are asking me to fork over the money AGAIN.

"I received an email from Uber giving me 50% off an order of $50 or more for groceries. Great! I placed an order at Safeway to be delivered the following day. Little did I know that I could not edit the order or chat with the person doing my shopping. Nor was I notified of any changes or substitutions. The order was scheduled for 5-6 pm. It got here almost an hour early, and I was not notified of that either. I ordered 2 of the 2 liter bottles of soda. They were out so I had put down to get a six pack of 16.9 oz bottles as a sub. Well, the shopper got me 2 of those, instead of the 1 I ordered. That cost an extra $6.58. I ordered 7 bananas. I received 7 pounds of HUGE bananas! Do you know how many bananas are in 7 pounds? 16! Look at the picture. I am so unhappy. I will never order groceries on Uber again. I can't even complain about this to them. There is no where to do that, so I am screwed!

"I am appalled that this miserable service is still in business! I have spent thousands of dollars on them since covid which makes no difference to them. 9 times out of 10, something is wrong with my order from a food delivery service, so I complain and expect to get reimbursed for what was wrong or left out. I ordered from Dominics yesterday, spent $53.00 and an item for $3.75 was left out. After arguing with the imbeciles at costumer service for over an hour, they finally told me my account is restricted because of the refunds they had to give in the past. Even though they left food that I paid for out of this order-tough! My account was obviously not too restricted since they accepted the order and took my money. DoorDash is wonderful and I highly recommend them. They actually have common sense as one of their basics and don't penalize the customer for restaurant mistakes. I will never use Uber Eats again as long as I live. If I could give them a minus 0 rating, I would.

"I delivered a triple order with an estimated cost of $20. I had to wait 10-15 minutes for chipotle to make the first two orders and after finally receiving the orders I proceeded next door to the chiles to pick up the last order. I then delivered said orders on time and as directed by the customers. After completion my tip was removed and my $20 order became $9. I screenshot this to have proof. A couple hours later it had been changed on the app that I received the full tip when I never received $11 of it. I also took a screenshot of this. This was not warranted. I am a diamond status driver with 100% satisfaction rate. I contacted support through live chat in regards to this and was continuously transferred to a ""more capable agent."" I then attempted to call and speak to someone over the phone but was placed on hold for over 20 minutes before the agent hung up on me without saying a word. Uber treats their drivers like complete trash and are not afraid to cover up stuff they should be correcting.

I could see on the map they were parked a block away so after I few minutes I tried to call the driver a couple times to see if they were lost but it was a non-working number. Then I got a notification that the driver was trying to reach me but I has no missed calls, texts or messages in the app. A little while later an old black sedan pulled up and a man (that I doubt was named Veronica) started walking up to my door. It turned out to be my order but it was more than a little concerning that the driver, car and contact information were incorrect. I sent a chat to Uber, the rep, Vinit, said he understood my concern that I received the wrong order which I didn't. Even though I had typed a detailed explanation at the beginning of the chat he was clueless. When I asked if he saw my original message he immediately end the chat (see screen shot). To top it off I received an email from Uber a couple of days later saying that they weren't going to give me a refund. I never asked for one! Inexcusable ""customer service"".

Interesting... it was being delivered to a well-known business in a single building (no suite number). UberEATS generously offered to refund my money (duh), but said they couldn't refund the tip! Seriously? So you want me to tip your driver for stealing my food? She says, ""you don't have to worry, we will refund your money for your food"". Oh what a relief! I thought I might have to worry about my husband not having lunch and the thief driver getting tipped. Wait, that's PRECISELY what happened! I will NEVER order through UberEATS again. Side note...

"Driver brought us someone else's order. Took order back, charged us $70 and Uber Eats won't refund us. We have no food and no order. We've been on hold for 40 minutes and they still can't resolve this! I will never use Uber Eats again and I will tell everyone I know not to use them! They said they won't give us a refund so they're thieves! Nice company stealing over $70 dollars from a family of 5 trying to feed their kids.

"Good day from Surrey, BC. Canada

Reaching out to share my one and only experience with Uber Eats. Simple story really. Ordered some ice cream, and had it delivered. Simple right... when the couple arrived at my home to drop off the order. The female literally started begging for a large tip. I mean I understand they don't get paid much, but this was to the point that we had to hide in our homes as this woman yelled ""Please, give us a better tip, over and over again.

I have promptly removed my credit information and deleted the app. Ive been using Skip the dishes for years and have never experienced this. Sorry, Uber eats, hire sane and professional ppl andyou'll keep new customers. Wow that was just terrible and disgusting service.

"Uber Rats is good until something is moot good. Received bloody, foul smelling food delivered to me by Uber Eats.
Turns out Uber Eats is responsible for the full refund but they don't tell you that. I contacted them n restaurant right away. Uber refunded me $13 out of $44.22.
Restaurant said they'd contact me re: a refund fior the remainder $31.23, didn't hear anything for 48 hrs. I was then told Uber Eats was responsible for full refund.
Contacted Uber Eats again and was told I'm too late now cause it's been 48hrs., even though I had contacted them immediately initially.
Sounds like a scam- lead ppl to believe that they did their part ( partial refund), you go after restaurant for the remainder only to find out Uber Eats was to provide the full refund initially. So by the time you get back to them, it's too late for your refund.

"I inadvertently placed a order today as I had items in my cart at one restaurant and decided to order from another. I hit backspace and it placed order to first restaurant i was considering. I noticed it immediately and in less than 1 minute contacted uber, as there was no option for me to cancel it thru app.
Now i have 2 order from 2 different restaurants arriving at same house at same time. Seems like there should be something in app that verifies that this is desired because obviously this was a mistake. I immediately contacted uber and they wouldn't cancel my order. They said i had to cancel it w restaurant but i made my order thru them. They have horrible customer service. I tried to contact the merchant but of course there was no phone number listed only a chat with and they never responded. After going back and forth with uber eats they finally gave me the merchants telephone number and by this time the order had already been filled and driver picked up order. The restaurant didnt actual answer the text only number until 2 hours after the food had already been delivered. Now any other time my uber order is always at least 30 plus minutes delayed from expected arrival but today of course not.
I won't be using uber eats again. They up price more than other apps, don't have accurate delivery times and if you are paying for service and something happens they should be helpful in resolving the issue especially when contacting them promptly regarding.

"I ordered this past Friday (City BBQ-Capital Blvd) not realizing they closed 20 minutes after I placed my order and the food was dry and tasteless. I feed it to my dogs. The only thing that was fresh/good was the side salad. I called the restaurant but they had already closed. I then decided to reach out to Uber Eats for a refund of everything minus the fresh salad. I wasn't thinking about pics at the time but I should've taken some of that dry meat and old Mac and Cheese before serving the dogs. Uber Eats decided not to reimburse me. If I would have realized it so.close to closing time I would have NEVER chose to order from that particular restaurant and chose another. I will NEVER order from this service ever again!

"I was ordering ubereats nearly everyday throughout the pandemic. There were so many times my food was late, cold, missing items or didn't show up at all. I sent many complaints which is acceptable due to how much I'm paying for a service plus tipping. I pretty much stopped ordering as much the past year. I was frustrated with the service. I received a gift card for Uber eats so I used it tonight. I ordered from Outback steakhouse. I ordered a pasta/steak meal, 2 apps, and 2 desserts. Well they never sent the pasta/steak, were late and the apps were cold. I couldn't believe I was missing items again. WTF. I called Uber and they said they couldn't issue me a refund because my account if flagged. It was flagged due to too many complaints from the past. I can't get a refund. My order was $78 plus tip. I'm just completely done with Uber. Yes I had a lot of complaints but I also ordered 5 to 7 days a week so yes I would have more complaints/missing food than the average person.
So since they don't understand that and there's no way to get refunds for missing food and crap service, I'm never ordering again.

"Got a gift card for Uber Eats. Tried to order something from a restaurant in the town where I live, I estimate it to be 10-12 minutes from my home. I put the order in and went to pay. I had to supplement the gift card with a credit card, which I did. The site refused to take the card. I tried 2 more cards and spent a half hour trying to figure out why the site wouldn't take them. I reviewed my info several times and it was all correct. The site didn't specify what the problem was. I scrapped the order and tried another restaurant that was also in town and in the same vicinity as the first one. This order was less and was covered by the gift card and it went through. The order took way too long to get here and the burgers and fries were cold and the fries were soggy. The restaurant failed to include the requested condiments and the plastic utensils. They didn't even include napkins. That was the first and last time I will use Uber Eats.
Tip for consumers:
If you are willing to pay the high cost of restaurant food today and willing to accept cold, soggy food, then Uber Eats is for you. It's not for me. I'll order over the phone, pick up my order and make sure everything is in the bag, and get it home before it gets cold and soggy. It's worth the little bit of extra effort. It's just not worth eating cold and soggy food and grousing about it the whole time you're eating it. Uber Eats is only for people who have no standards with what they eat.

I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

Now I'm far away, then they tried to steer me to a ""deal"" that was more expensive. I tried to use their chat and it didn't help.

So I tried and ordered with the promo coupon provided. It seemed applied successfully, however, when they send me the receipt, the promo coupon actually did not applied to the balance. Besides the extra services fees, delivery fees, the cost is almost 50% higher than I just order and pick up from the restaurant nearby. I was able to use chat function to ask help from a customer service, he claimed that he adjusted and refund the portion related to the promo code, and would send me an email. But I never received the email. While chatting with him, he abrupted ended the chat. When I try to chat again, found the chat function on my account was disabled.

The second time I tried to order a similar dinner from the same restaurant. I was using a computer and could not register the site on my phone. The site wiped the information page and I lost contact with the driver. There is no phone or connection help from Uber that I could find. The driver lett the meal on the street in from of my house. It was found by a neighbor and brought in. I cannot blame the driver for this debacle. I blame Uber. I will not use their services again.

"Ordered from UberEats during our snowstorm (wasn't snowing at that moment) and after about 5 minutes I realized nothing was happening on their tracker, so I called the restaurant and found out it was closed due to the weather. In the meantime whoever was there or maybe the restaurant's system automatically accepted the order (even tho store was closed). Went to UberEats to cancel the order, really as a courtesy, and they said because the order was accepted (at a restaurant that was closed so also I blame the restaurant) they were going to charge me 13.27 to compensate the driver (who didn't exist) and themselves of course. That is actually more than the cost of the meal I ordered. I threatened a lawsuit and they gave me a $5.00 credit (big whoop). I'll use that credit once and then cancelling my subscription.

"I was gifted Uber Eats gift two cards totaling $50. I decided to use them for two Pizza Hut carry-out pizzas. I was stunned to find that one pizza through Uber Eats was $46.48. I ordered a second identical pizza directly from Pizza Hut and the cost was $17.35. I use this Pizza Hut regularly and that is the ""normal"" price for the pizza I ordered. When I picked up the two pizzas, I asked the manager why there would be such a huge difference in the cost of two identical pizzas. He just laughed and said I'd have to ask Uber Eats. All the customers in the store heard the story and got a good laugh. Of course there is no way to talk to Uber Eats but no explanation could possibly justify a $30 up charge on a $18 pizza.

I placed a shipping order, days later, have not received my order. Contacted UberEATS via chat, 2 hours and 5 reps later, I do not have a tracking number. I called customer service, they could not provide a tracking number after 20 minutes.
I am out $$ and 2 and a half hours of my life. Horrible customer service, horrible experience. Do not order thru UberEATS, order directly from establishment.

"I was at a friends house and try to order two pizzas when ordering I noticed that it was going to my house so I instantly canceled it and re-did the same order within one second to the same place for the same food. I also was delivered that food from this place. I find out that I'm going to be charged for the first cancel delivery when I ask why they tell me the merchant started making my food. Well that can't be because within one second all I did was change the address, not cancel the order a the order is placed on the app one minute apart so even if they had started making my food, they didn't lose anything because I re-ordered it right away But I know they didn't start making it in one minute but regardless I got that food. All I did was change the address and they are trying to charge me the additional $35 so it would be $70 for a pizza what they're saying makes no sense and it is a total lie. They are just trying to rob me so I canceled my premium account I'm going to dispute. The charges with my credit card is fraud and I'm never going to use Uber again when I use literally almost use them daily and they let a premium member go also they could keep this $35 they seem pretty desperate and after that I would never trust them again there total liars and the customer service is terrible. They just click right up on you and they don't even respond to any other messages.

"The only positive review I can give is to the customer service rep who was able to cancel my order that was 2 hours late and couldn't get a driver for. While Uber Eats loves to spam my email with rewards and deals, none of them are applicable to any of the restaurants within a 40 mile radius of my home. So I'm really not getting a good deal. Also, there are barely any uber eats drivers which is why my order was 2+ hours late. No one was accepting the pick up. I ordered with Doordash five minutes after my Uber Eats order was cancelled and a driver immediately accepted it. I got it in under 30 minutes, no complaints. And it was even cheaper than UberEats. Same restaurant, same order. Switch to Doordash.

"They can take that $25 and put it where the sun doesn't shine. I wouldn't order from this company if you gave me free food and paid me to do so. Their help center for your employees are completely useless and aren't worth calling to fix a single thing. They pay them (drivers) next to nothing. Their app is faulty and you steal their tips. Not to mention their trips/completed deliveries disappear. They only care about lining their pockets and screwing over their drivers. Oh and they live blaming their drivers for their issues. Lack responsibility on all counts. Good job UberEATS... Not! Wish I could give them negative stars.

"I just ordered two curry goats from Wilson Caribbean Cuisine and it was extremely disappointing! I had instructed the store to tie it up securely. The time before this they had taped up the plastic bag in a perfect manner. This time it was like they were being too cheap and careless. Right after I wrote the review on them, they wrote back saying that they ALWAYS tape it up secure for UBER EATS etc. and how whatever happens when the driver picks up the food is NOT their responsibility! So now i am sure your company is going to say the same thing as their company said. Ugh. This is sooo dangerous! It is extremely bad to mess with restaurants, and UBER EATS etc. I now see that trust none is a great motto!

"1. Drivers get to restaurant, but then cancel the order forcing Uber Eats to find another driver only for them to do the same. Dudes, just go to the place and pick up the order and bring it here!
2. Drivers take the longest routes possible when the shorter routes would guarantee food safety is being met! Where are you guys going, going in the OPPOSITE direction of my house!?
3. Good luck getting straight answers, cause they have an automated bot replying and not fully grasping what you're telling them.
4. I pay for priority service, in the hopes that they aren't taking alt routes to get to my place. That they take the order straight here. In the hopes that the food will be edible. It is an absolute joke.
5. Uber Eats is a business designed to pick up orders and bring them to the customers. But they are no longer efficient.
6. Oh and good luck getting EVERYTHING in your order. They will not double check the order to make sure everything is there. I've been shorted menu items because the stores went ""Here you go"" to uber eats and NEITHER ONE checked to make sure everything was THERE.
Tip for consumers:
Make sure you put in instructions, to tell both uber eats and restaurant to double check the order is complete. Make sure you give adequate instructions about where your driveway is located. Make double certain that you check the order as well when it arrives. Do not become complacent sheep about this. Speak up, use your voice and don't let people walk all over you.

"After my first mishap with them of no one delivering my food after 2 hours I thought to stupidly give them another chance…well I was wrong to. I ordered Starbucks when I received my coffees and sandwiches my ice coffee was melted and there was no ice left, my sandwiches were cold and my grande hot coffee was cold and only half the cup was full. I reached out to Uber that half my coffee was missing and just like the first time they refused me a refund and it was pretty much a ""not our problem"" kind of thing. They told me to reach out for further assistance to which no one ever got back to me. I never have this problem with DoorDash and Grubhub. If there's an issue they refund you no problems but Uber eats ask for proof you show them proof and then it's like oh well.

"I placed an order and canceled it immediately when I discovered it was going to the wrong location. They continue to process my order even though it was confirmed that it was canceled and they took my money. When I called Uber Eats I spoke with a man named Joseph who also confirmed that it was canceled and still claims that I would not get a refund called the entire cost of the order a cancellation fee which by the was is over $50 and refused to call the place to change the location to send it too! When I asked to speak to a supervisor he said one would call back but didn't give a timeframe in fact he said there wasn't a timeframe, and that his supervisor name is Kevin. He was very unprofessional and I now am out of money and I never got the order that again should have never been processed since I canceled the order.

"June 17,2023: My wife just ordered from Uber Eats for Father's Day. $75 order from Taka Japanese restaurant in Wayne, NJ. The Uber driver sent a picture of the door where the food was left through the Uber App which was not our door. When we contacted them to complain that we never received the food and that the house shown on the pic provided by the driver was not our house, several chat people (I chatted with 2 different agents) stated that the order address was correct (which it was) and that the food was delivered to that address, which of course was not true. I told them that their driver did not deliver to the address they confirmed and asked to speak to a manager. Uber Eats would not provide a manager on the chat nor a phone number we could call to speak to someone in person in order to file a complaint. They refused to refund the order, holding to the lie that the food was actually delivered to the address on record. I told them I could send them a picture of our home to prove that their driver was lying, but they simply repeated the lie and stopped the chat 2 times. I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. I had used them many times before, but will NEVER USE THEM AGAIN after this despicable incident. Uber Customer service is an absolute scam. They will take your money, drop off the food anywhere and then refuse to deal with the customer when confronted. The app provided NO SALES RECEIPT. Shameful.

"Terrible customer service and terrible ownership But I expect that from those people that work up there. I ordered on Uber eats and I got the 10 piece with extra crispy and all drum. Extra crispy and all drum cost about 75 cent each so I paid for it. When it came I didn't have the all drums or the extra crispy but of course you know they charged me. They obviously don't pay attention to what people order or they don't care. I think it's because they just don't care. And if you go up there and look at those type of people they actually look like the type of people they don't care about anything or anyone unless they look and talk like them. Uber eats didn't give me my money back because they said the store doesn't do refunds. So I would advise people to not order from Uber eats at the store and honestly I won't be going back at all.

"So for months leading up to about two months ago, Uber eats was sending me come back please come back. I had so many issues in the past with deliveries and people not checking the orders. So going to have hip and knee replacement surgery and I started Uber eats again. I have placed three orders. All three orders were wrong not only wrong, but everyone was late by 15 to 30 minutes from its original time. I had people deceive me the drivers deceive me three orders in a row were wrong today I ordered from Karaba's. I didn't get bread which I requested to chop double check the order to make sure I got two loaves of bread and all the salad dressings and everything that go along with it not only was I missing, the bread, but my salad dressing why would you give me a salad to salad with no dressing no house dressing. I was also missing the ricotta in my meatballs and ricotta side item. So when I asked the young lady and she was very nice if she had saw my message to check the over order over double and triple to make sure I had everything. She said no they told me it was all there, and then she told me that she's not allowed to open the bag which is not correct. So I subsequent her tip based on that theory and lie. This was a big mistake to come back to you. I know nobody cares. I know nobody is going to read this and contact me. And that's fine.

Uber Customer service is an absolute scam. They will take your money, drop off the food anywhere and then refuse to deal with the customer when confronted. The app provided NO SALES RECEIPT. Shameful.

"Terrible customer service and terrible ownership But I expect that from those people that work up there. I ordered on Uber eats and I got the 10 piece with extra crispy and all drum. Extra crispy and all drum cost about 75 cent each so I paid for it. When it came I didn't have the all drums or the extra crispy but of course you know they charged me. They obviously don't pay attention to what people order or they don't care. I think it's because they just don't care. And if you go up there and look at those type of people they actually look like the type of people they don't care about anything or anyone unless they look and talk like them. Uber eats didn't give me my money back because they said the store doesn't do refunds. So I would advise people to not order from Uber eats at the store and honestly I won't be going back at all.

"In the high likelihood the driver screws up your order, or can't find your house, the customer service chat won't help you, and there's no phone number to call, save yourself the headache… the driver found my community complex but couldn't find my house, which was clearly marked on my profile, the idiot driver marked my order complete and left, the chat morons said they delivered to the address and wouldn't give me a refund, I've never been so angry at a company, again do not use, take my word for it! Not the first order they screwed me over on either. -5 stars

"So for months leading up to about two months ago, Uber eats was sending me come back please come back. I had so many issues in the past with deliveries and people not checking the orders. So going to have hip and knee replacement surgery and I started Uber eats again. I have placed three orders. All three orders were wrong not only wrong, but everyone was late by 15 to 30 minutes from its original time. I had people deceive me the drivers deceive me three orders in a row were wrong today I ordered from Karaba's. I didn't get bread which I requested to chop double check the order to make sure I got two loaves of bread and all the salad dressings and everything that go along with it not only was I missing, the bread, but my salad dressing why would you give me a salad to salad with no dressing no house dressing. I was also missing the ricotta in my meatballs and ricotta side item. So when I asked the young lady and she was very nice if she had saw my message to check the over order over double and triple to make sure I had everything. She said no they told me it was all there, and then she told me that she's not allowed to open the bag which is not correct. So I subsequent her tip based on that theory and lie. This was a big mistake to come back to you. I know nobody cares. I know nobody is going to read this and contact me. And that's fine.

"I mainly do Uber eats for extra money on the side, I like DoorDash better due to Uber eats sending you to restaurants that are closed or permanently closed and only giving you $3 for a $21+ order. They take forever when it comes to customer service/getting help. Recently I did delivers all night and when I went to cash out, it wouldn't let me. They told me I have a hold on my account bc of not delivering my deliveries when I know that I delivered every single one.
I'm wondering if a customer lied or what but they should be able to see my driving/me msging my customers telling them that I delivered their food. It's annoying because I can't get all my hard work/earned money and have to wait for this process for them to go everything which will take forever. I would've just saved my gas and not done any deliveries. DoorDash doesn't have this problem and they will give you at least half of the trip if the restaurant is closed/if the customer cancels. I'll be switching back to DD.

What drive me crazy its fact yall dont listen to customor when there error going when there techinal issue when app. My order disappear nd reappear. Than my drive cancel. They request new driver time frame i wont be around the time it arrive. There so much problem uber eat cause that if this doesnt stop going they show no respect toward customers or how you feel pretty soon no one will order from you. Cause that true treat people how you want to be treated show respect to customor customers is alway right. But never take advance of customers never use customers money has greed. Most importantly show honor for people who has memebership. If order keep coming in wrong or incorrect. Or Driver cancel and request new one if customor is busy cant be around yall not gonna refund when it wasnt customers fault for time frame it suppose to be and stop? If it cancel person need to be going out yall dont listen that customor wont be around that time. Ur gonna still charge them that is call poor customor service.

"I made the MISTAKE of leaving GrubHub after the site reported suspicious activity on my account and logged me out. However, now that I think about it, no additional fees were missing from my bank account & I believe it was simply a technical error. Long story short, I rejoined GrubHub recently(I will NEVER leave again as it's been THE BEST food experience for me ever) and will not be using Uber Eats again in the future. Uber Eats reminds me too much of my HORRIBLE experience with Door Dash and the shady, sketchy, dishonest people they tend to hire.

A restaurant cancelled my order and Uber Eats DID NOT refund the money to my account AT ALL although they were supposed to. It showed as a PENDING refund transaction(for 24 dollars) in my bank account but NEVER went through. Reason being, Uber Eats KEPT my money and DID NOT even CREDIT it to my Uber Eats account. I have NEVER had that issue with GrubHub! GRUBHUB ALWAYS refunds my money AUTOMATICALLY rather I cancel the order or the restaurant cancels it. It may take a few minutes to show up in my account but it always DOES.

However, the final straw for me with Uber Eats was not only the young lady who bothered showing up to work on a 100 degree day, but refused to get out of her car and walk two feet to come inside my AIR CONDITIONED apartment building to deliver my food as instructed, but instead, insisted she was not coming in because it was too hot and I needed to come out to her(pajamas and all), but also the rude young man who showed up a day later acting as if common sense were a foreign language basically claiming he did not know how to turn a corner in my super small complex to find my building address. He also threw my straw on the ground because I told him he needed to turn the corner to find my building(bear in mind there are only three buildings on each side. Not exactly a maze). He was being facetious and I have no time for that. GOODBYE Uber Eats! Kick rocks! HELLO AGAIN GrubHub! Please forgive me for forsaking your AWESOME service!

So happy I know that Uber Eats is not all it's cracked up to be! NEVER EVER again! Uber Eats is simply a more upscale version of Door Dash(sic). If you've ever used Door Dash, you know that's not saying very much!
Tip for consumers:
If you're considering leaving GrubHub to use Uber Eats, DON'T do it for ANY reason. It's not worth it in my honest opinion.

"I deleted this app and will never use this service again. I recently needed to cancel an order and went through the process. The app and Uber never disclosed that at the point in my order I would not receive any sort of refund. If I had known this or was informed in the order cancellation process I would have never canceled the order. I've now paid for food that is no longer getting delivered to me. Who would want that out of a food delivery service? That's not ethical. I would understand if I had been warned beforehand about this charge during to cancellation order process but instead found this out after the fact. The customer service team gave me some awesome cookie cutter responses about reaching out to support when cancelling an order in the future. Why have the option to do it yourself in the app if best practice is to reach out to their team? I'd be careful with this one. Use DoorDash or Favor, I've never had this issue with them. Zero stars

"On 5/30/23 we order a bill amount of $120+ through Uber Eats from a local restaurant.
Per usual, it was assigned to a driver who sat outside the restaurant for 10-15 minutes ""picking up our order"" before cancelling.
We were then assigned a new driver.
That new driver came and he delivered ONLY lemonade.
When we asked him what happened, he said the restaurant told him, ""a different Uber driver picked up the food.""
Called the restaurant, they confirmed his story. Nobody could or wanted to help refund or remedy the situation.
So I paid for the dinner AGAIN & we called Uber Eats customer service.
They took a WHOLE $#*! REPORT, told me I'd be contact directly by a representative in 24/48 hours and a refund would occur to the original payment method on file.
I've watched every day since then and have yet to 1) get a call back or 2) see a refund.
6/12/23: I called Uber customer service to f/u. They want to tell me that they see I spoke to someone but that someone only mentioned giving us a call back, NOT issuing a refund. So because this is over 8 hours old, THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE MONEY.
I asked to speak or be transferred to a supervisor - but told there were none and I'd have to be called back.
I asked to speak to the supervisor - told that I'd get the exact same answer about not refunding my money.
I asked to speak to the supervisor - and was told that ""I can file a complaint against the driver through a different department"".
I told her the issue isn't with the driver, it's with Uber. It's their employee that stole my food, it's their customer service team who incorrectly told me one think while documentating something entirely different. It's their department who is JUSTIFYING a driver STEALING $120+ of food from a customer and NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM.
They claim they'll call me today. They claim I'll speak to someone who has their head pulled from their $#*!. And they claim I will NOT receive a refund.

"I saw I had a promo code for 90% off if I spend at least R150, so I decided to use it. I decided to use the code and after saying that my order would only be R40 it took the full amount of R170 off my card. I immediately tried to cancel the order and then it got canceled but charged R150 as a cancelation fee off my R170 order, leaving me poor and with no food. The app is poorly designed and confusing and the fee of cancelation after a just minute off placing the order when the restaurant could not have possibly started making my food is ridiculous. After numerous phone calls I was then told to use the help feature on the app which was of no assistance whatsoever!

I posted proof that I had the promo codes.

"The company is total disrespect for the customer! Every time I have to use their services I am greatly disappointed. A glitchy app and website, useless customer support, nonsensical policies, scam. Complete trash.
Here's a couple of examples. I get two $25 vouchers. Uber Eats does not let me apply them both to one order (!). OK, I am placing one order for $24, and then another one for $24. Those crooks apply one $25 voucher to my first order, and then the remaining $1 - to the second order and charge my credit card for $23! The customer has no control over it when placing orders. What's even worse, when placing the second order, the website shows me that it would apply my voucher and my total would be $0... but then I eventually get charged for $23. Scam! I submit a ticket with their customer service demanding explanation and refund. After a long back-and-forth over email I am left with nothing. ""It is how it works. No refund will be issued."" Basically: suck it up.
Here's another one. I am trying to place a pickup order. It only shows me a delivery option (for $5) for that restaurant location. I don't want to pay for the delivery. The restaurant is on my way. I'd rather pick up my order. It is my choice. Out of curiosity, I go to the restaurant and talk to them. They are saying: ""Of course, we do accept pickups. It is Uber Eats that does something so the option is not available. We don't know why."" Scam #2!
The only reason I am still a customer is that my employer sends me free vouchers every now and then. A necessary evil. Shame!

My first order was on it's way, the driver was 7min away then it went to 11min, then 12min then the driver cancelled it.
I called the restaurant who confirmed the driver had left ages ago with my order. I went through every help section sending messages, nowhere there to contact direct. Even tried googling, no number that would go through unless i wanted to pay £3.60 a minute. After half an hour looking, reordered and waited ages again. 2 or 3 drivers arrived at the restaurant and then cancelled. By the time the final driver arrived and delivered my food was 9.40pm and originally started my order at 6.25pm!
Never again, why can i contact DELIVEROO CUSTOMER SERVICES AND NOT YOURS?

"I've had numerous complaints from local individuals about their food being delivered to wrong address, arriving late, never announcing delivered, not being delivered within the time frame for food safety standards... A prior home owner from 3 owners ago (my house) failed to update their address in their uber eats and I started getting their orders all of a sudden. I've tried it a few times and often felt uncomfortable eating the food for fear of sanitation concerns.

The job it self isn't all that great. I had a friend do it and you're pretty much a delivery driver. Good lord it's not that difficult to read an address fellow uber eats coworkers. Pay isn't all that great either. The amount of wear and tear you put on your car is ridiculous. The cost in maintenance and fixing doesn't do justice for your pay. The only good this job did me was the amount of auto collecting it let my gotcha evolve get in pokemon go.

(gotcha evolve auto collects pokemon in pokemon go and allows me to play hands free basically. One cheat is you can use it while driving. Legal so long as your phone remains zipped in a pocket.)

"A couple of weeks ago their driver canceled my order after almost an hour of wasting. They couldn't explain why and gave me a credit. I wanted to use the credit so I ordered burgers. Their driver took an hour to get to me and made 2 othet stops. My only thought was the food is going to be cold. Yep. Cheese was cold and stiff and fries were cold. Called customer service and they said there's nothing they can do since it arrived 15 mins early. More like an hour. They don't care if the driver has a few stop and the last person's food to be delivered will be cold. They said the food got here on time. That's all that mattered. Will not go with them again and I will past this info to everyone I know. Uber eats is ridiculous. I'm surprised they r even still in business.

"When Uber Eats first started you could order restaurant quality food. Now I feel like restaurants can give you anything and there is no recourse. The amount of crappy thrown together food I get is just disgusting. I ordered Outback surf and turf. The lobster (no butter) was like eating a piece of rubber. Like it was cooked in a microwave. The steak was a filet m-rare and I doubt it was a filet. I wondered why the 8oz was cheaper than the 6oz. The salad cucumbers were opaque, which is a clear sign of spoiling. The bread came with no butter and of course you have to top it off with no utensils. Despite clicking would like to add utensils (don't even know why that's even an option).
The only thing that was good was the cheesecake. I'm going to attribute that to the fact that it came out of box.

What is the recourse for that? I paid almost 2hrs of my hard earned work to get meal. Should delivery meals get the crap end of the deal? Uber nor the restaurant has any recourse for crap food. I get it it would be costly to except every complaint.
Consumers are getting poor quality food delivered because of this. Something needs to be put in place for people who use the service. At this point this is starting to be like a scam. I guarantee if anyone ever did an inquiry into this it would have many people upset. The consumer is being scammed.

Whether that be letting people check their food upon delivery or quality control checks at restaurants.

For now my only option is to stop using Uber. It's just starting to be more of a loss of like for a lot of restaurants and waste of money. I've slowed down tremendously in my usage of Uber. Today is definitely a day that will reduce even that.

"A lot of gall. Will never use again! Placed order with UberEats website saying ""55-65min wait"". One hour later, status saying an additional hour. Between ""delivery"", ""service fees"", and tip, additional fees on my order was over $20. Called Customer Service to ask how UberEats thinks it is acceptable for a customer to have to wait an additional hour from what they originally said it would take and they did not see any issue with it. After having to restate my complaint multiple times, they finally offered a 20% refund on only the cost if the meal which didnt even cover half of the fees. I ended up canceling altogether.

"To Whom it May Concern,

I have tried using uber eats twice. Both times I picked Buffalo Wild Wings in Columbus MS for my food provider. When I ordered the first time I was advised that it would take 40-50 minutes for the food to be delivered. After waiting for
Nearly 2 hours I called and cancelled the order. The order delivery time kept extending. And we decided it would be easier to go get something vs wait an indefinite period. My next experience was with Buffalo Wild Wings again.
This time I ordered and was given a wait time of 40-50 minutes again. After an hour of waiting my order was cancelled. I Have no idea who cancels orders or why. This is absolutely one of the poorest ways to let someone know
They wont get their order tonight. There is no one to call or discuss the issue with. So basically I have done nothing but try to use Uber Eats and as a customer I was $#*! on twice. I am a platinum AX card holder and I must say
I am extremely disappointed in the uber eats business program, especially when it comes to delivery times and the ability to follow up with a person should your order get cancelled. I would bet my AX payment next month which would
Total over 10k, should I give uber eats and Buffalo Wild Wings another shot, the order will get canceled or after 2 hours of waiting I will cancel it. There is no reason to wait for 2 hours for delivery. I literally live 2.0 miles from the store.

"I recently used Uber Eats for the first time and am extremely dissatisfied with the support and customer service I received. I had a promotional code for 15€ off my first order, but I had to cancel the initial order to add my VISA card as a payment method. After doing so, my promo code was no longer available, and despite explaining the situation in detail to Uber Eats support, I was denied a refund or a new promo code.

I understand that businesses must have policies and standards, but it is clear that my intention was to use the code on my first REAL order, not on one I had to cancel due to technical issues. The lack of flexibility and understanding in this case is disappointing and leaves much to be desired in terms of customer service.

After several exchanges with the support team, I was told they couldn't provide a different resolution despite acknowledging my situation. This leads me to believe that Uber Eats is the worst food delivery company I have trusted, as they have not only been unable to resolve a simple issue but have also lost another customer due to their rigidity and inflexibility.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Uber Eats to anyone after this experience and will be looking for other food delivery options in the future. It is a shame that such a large and well-known company has such poor customer service and an inability to adapt to specific situations. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of choosing a food delivery service that values and caters to the needs of their customers, and Uber Eats does not.

"I just started working for this company delivering orders and already had my account deactivated. It hasn't even been a week so I was still learning the ropes trying to figure things our because it was confusing. I had to cancel some orders because addresses kept disappearing and saying next order i had no idea what was going on again I am new to this so the only thing I could do was cancel because I do no address. I had to get a pass to get on base in thought because I was a dasher I didn't need one until I was told I did. Right while I was in the process of getting the pass my account got deactivated I'm stick with food I didn't want or need because the stores will not take back food due to Covid and other stuff I'm sure. Customers were refunded and if made no tip on the orders that were canceled so I just wasted gas that your all don't pay for. Again I am new to this and have to learn that's messed up to do people that way who are just trying to make a honest living. Not everyone is a scammer or fraud maybe trying helping or sending a warning first even twice because firing people. It's bad enough you take from the tips so what we should make we don't because yall take fees from the tips we make. I went through all the process passing a background check proof of care insurance everything yall asked me too so I did and you go and do this all because I was confused and trying to learn why not just help me instead. I would never recommend your company to anyone and if suggest that everyone go look for better ways to make money because this is not it they are unfair unprofessional and cold.

I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I just got fired from them yesterday September 23,2022. They said they fired me due to not taking enough orders or cancelling ok I understand that. But I did have life going on while living in the car. ( Life happens) but I made it to Platinum in 3 days! Anyway when u go below a certain rating they classify you as (fraud) then when you try to cash out like you normally do they have the system automatically say it's down so you can call them and they can tell you why this happen and when you will get your money. Enjoy working for them watch out for the businesses and people you deliver to even customer service ( Uber eats) because people have the power to review you, view you and make you lose your job, ratings are everything and sometimes you truly can't control your ratings. It's always something when you trying to better yourself.

"I've been a frequent user of Uber Eats primarily because they deliver from restaurants that other, more reputable food service delivery companies don't tend to deliver from. In my opinion, this is the only plus that Uber Eats has going for them. I can't count on both hands the number of times my deliveries don't make it to the correct address. This is always a big inconvenience, even when the cost of the meal and driver tips are waived. I had this issue again this evening. Only this time I was told by the customer service representative that my order was delivered to the correct address and I wasn't eligible for a credit. Six different customer service representatives and myself attempted to contact the driver. The driver didn't pick up a single phone call. Meanwhile; I had DoorDash deliver the order. By the time I finished up my six phone calls, I attempted to cancel the tip for the driver that didn't deliver my meal. I was told by 3 additional representatives that I couldn't have a credit to make original form of payment. This is an issue as I'll never use this service again. In my opinion, the beyond poor customer service that Uber Eats stands by will put them out of business in the future.

I recommend against using this delivery service.

I was able to figure out that it applied the $0 delivery for orders over $15 and it was counteracting my voucher so I had to order under that amount for the promo not to automatically apply and be able to place the order but it was so annoying because I couldn't use the full value of my voucher and I lost out on it yesterday due to going back and forth.

"Uber left me and my disabled mom stranded in another state and city. They have no number for riders to call for assistance. No you can't speak to someone else, No you can't speak to a supervisor, and no there is no other option to contact them other than email. Unacceptable. Uber responded to my email (of being stranded) 5 hours later. They dropped us off at a restaurant and then abandoned us. I couldn't call for a ride home because my phone number was wrong and associated with an old account. And you're not able to request a ride without a valid phone number. I'm switching to lyft to see how there customer service is.
Tip for consumers:
Uber Eats has a customer service line to call but they just refund part of the cost. You don't get all your money back for messed up orders. They don't address all the additonal fees, takes and tips associated with getting food delivered. If everything workout uber eats is good, but if you have problems its a scam.

"I have ordered food often through Uber Eats and have had several issues receiving my food order. They have very poor customer service. The support agents will not go the extra mile to help a customer out. They give you a bunch of lies. If you ask them for a managers name and contact info, they refuse to give you the info. All they say they can do is give you a refund. They claim they try and get in touch with the driver. They put you on hold for 3-5 minutes not knowing if they are really trying to contact the driver. All they say is that they couldn't reach the driver. If a customer asks for the managers contact information, they must provide it. If you want to gain respect from me, and receive a better review, I strongly suggest your support team learn to offer better customer service and go the extra mile. Pay the support agent needs to take customer service classes and learn the customers are the ones who pay the salary of your company.

"Uber left me and my disabled mom stranded in another state and city. They have no number for riders to call for assistance. No you can't speak to someone else, No you can't speak to a supervisor, and no there is no other option to contact them other than email. Unacceptable. Uber responded to my email (of being stranded) 5 hours later. They dropped us off at a restaurant and then abandoned us. I couldn't call for a ride home because my phone number was wrong and associated with an old account. And you're not able to request a ride without a valid phone number. I'm switching to lyft to see how there customer service is.
Tip for consumers:
Uber Eats has a customer service line to call but they just refund part of the cost. You don't get all your money back for messed up orders. They don't address all the additonal fees, takes and tips associated with getting food delivered. If everything workout uber eats is good, but if you have problems its a scam.

"I have ordered food often through Uber Eats and have had several issues receiving my food order. They have very poor customer service. The support agents will not go the extra mile to help a customer out. They give you a bunch of lies. If you ask them for a managers name and contact info, they refuse to give you the info. All they say they can do is give you a refund. They claim they try and get in touch with the driver. They put you on hold for 3-5 minutes not knowing if they are really trying to contact the driver. All they say is that they couldn't reach the driver. If a customer asks for the managers contact information, they must provide it. If you want to gain respect from me, and receive a better review, I strongly suggest your support team learn to offer better customer service and go the extra mile. Pay the support agent needs to take customer service classes and learn the customers are the ones who pay the salary of your company. I will not use your company again until your customer service ratings get better. Very horrible customer service.

We understand this may be upsetting, and want to let you know that we have processes in place to review this type of feedback with merchants and delivery people. Even though we won't be able to provide a refund, we will relay this feedback to the merchant.

Thank you for taking the time to let us know about this. We hope to offer you a better experience on your next order. THIS IS WHAT THEY WROTE AFTER I SPENT 80 DOLLARS ON MY ORDER AND COUDNT EAT IT GARBAGE ALL THE WAY, MY FOOD CAME INSIDE THE BAG AND IT WAS LIQUID.

"Horrible service. I am a business owner and used the uber eats site when i took over a business and informed them that the owner of the business had changed. They did not assist me when i attempted to change the bank details to recieve the payments and after many emails and calls they supposedly sent the money to me but when i sent them proof that this was not the case i was then told it was sent to the previous owner who assured me this was not the case and as i am no longer in contact i cannot get proof. Uber was aware that there was a change of owner and did not warn me or say anything about not using the previous owners account but now they have not sent the money they are telling me i shouldnt have continued using the previous owners account despite me being in contact with them about me using this account previously. Their support system is shocking and the drivers come much later than they are supposed to and the customer will not be updated that the driver is not at the shop and will instead be told that the restaurant is preparing the food which leads customers to leave negative feedback as they are unaware that it is ubers fault. The drivers regularly steal the food and Uber do nothing about it. Overall the service they provide is so bad and i do not reccommend using them as it will only negatively afftect your business.

I have had app issues and called ubereats to let them know the issue on three different occasions and the last time I was given two tesco orders and my app was playing up so couldn't see the addresses so had to call ubereats for support.

I didn't receive a confirmation that my order was processed and no food arrived. Safe to assume my order was canceled. Two days later while checking my bank account I noticed a charge for Uber Eats. I called Uber Eats customer service. That I'm itself is a joke. I was there was no order on my account and to contact my bank. Contacted the bank and there were two charges from Uber Eats. Called Uber Eats again going another human posing as a robot and they explained that I failed to contact Uber Eats within 48 hours of my delivery. What delivery? I canceled it! It never processed and no food arrived! I was told if I log onto the side I might want to check if any charges posted that way I have time to dispute the charges.

I spoke to Justin and Charmaine both on online support and no one could help me. They ended the conversation without saying goodbye. I was charged on my checking account $85.32 when it shows $62.15 on Uber. When the order was placed it said 8532 so I went in and canceled it immediately. The restaurant did not contact me Uber Eats did not contact me. I consider this bait and switch I will not be using Uber Eats any longer and I will report them to their headquarters and write a letter about this I can see why the reviews are 1.5.

"If I could rate a zero I would. I just had the worst experience using Uber eats. I was already on the fence about using food delivery services, but decided to give it a try. I placed an order of food and instantly realized that my order was wrong. I tried to cancel the order immediately but couldn't find where to do it. It took me about 15 mins to figure out how to cancel my order. I had the ride share app only not Uber eats app. I even tried to call the restaurant but no success. I discovered I had to cancel the order in Uber eats app not the ride share app. When I finally cancelled the order and did not get the food I thought the order was cancelled successfully. I discovered the money still was charged to my account the next morning. I chatted with an Uber employee and was advised when I cancel an order after a merchant has accepted the order I still have to pay the merchant. I asked where was the food the employee ended the chat. So, I talked to 2 other employees before I understood what happen. I will never use this option again. They where not willing to give my money back. They called it fees and told me I should have reached out to them before I cancelled the order. Wow! Lost 46.00 and no food. High way robbery.

Recently UberEats offered me free trial of UberOne which gives me good discounts and therefore I ordered from Pizza Pizza through UberEats for the first time. However, the ordered pizza arrived cold. I asked for replacement from UberEats and they denied. Therefore the lesson is: Never order pizza through UberEats or else you will forego the service guarantee as promised by the merchant.

In Miami my Uber eats was fire no problems hardly any complaining food was always fresh even fast foods. Once I moved to Ft Walton Beach FL. Uber Eats Sucks here. 1) They always forget an item on the order. 2) they always forget to bring STRAWS in the bags especially fast food joints, they forget to put STRAWS like who order a drink and doesn't get a straw? Help me out here. 3) they've been cancelling my order right when it's about to be delivered. They make me wait like 2 hrs for the food and then leaving a message saying they cancelled, it's so late I can't order again. 4) was the last straw because these people brought my steak with out my Brussels sprouts or my carrots.

"I placed an order through McDonald's delivery app which was issued through Uber eats. The service I received was absolutely disgusting. The customer service advisors were unhelpful. I contacted them in regards to my order not arriving, even though the tracker stated my order was delivered. According to the advisor the rider stated on the system that he tried to contact me. Which was NOT the case as I have not received any notifications or a door knock. I spoke to the manager named Esha to explain my situation and she was extremely rude and dismissive, hanging the phone on me when I asked her a question. I still have not received a refund or my order which is unacceptable. Not only has it caused an inconvenience it has really upset me due to the way I have been treated. The advisors have taken the riders word and completely ignored my situation due to the ""guidelines"". I am now still sitting here with no food to eat and my money being held hostage. I don't understand how these people can work in customer ""support"", and have no ounce of humanity or compassion, I will be taking this matter further.

"Just tried using Uber Eats for the first time. Only reason to try is because my company gave me a gift card (thanks :() . They were supposed to give a $15 credit because it was my first time, didn't happen. While trying to find why the credit didn't appear I placed the order without it giving me the opportunity to say no it wasn't correct yet. Instead they charged my credit card. I immediately tried to figure out how to cancel, took me a few minutes. By the time I did they said it was too late and charged me a cancellation fee. There is no way the restaurant even had time to start the order.

"I had canceled my order immediately after it was placed. I had a $20 promotion to use. When switching payment methods, the promotion was taken off. When I realized this immediately I canceled the order and then had placed another order. I should not be charged for the cancelation. I Contacted the restaurant, and they said they didn't accept the order since it was canceled within 2 minutes. Uber eats wants to scam and con customers out of their money. Tell me why EVERY customer service agent wasn't based out of the US and word for word said the same exact thing to me as if they were reading from a transcript?! Uber eats please just stop doing business in general. As you told me word for word you're more concerned about the merchants than the customers doing business. These corporations make me SICK

Called the restraraunt and she at least aknowledge that they did not make sure the drive got the entire order and the rest of my order was still sitting ythere but in order to get it delivered she would have to all UberEats. 30 minutes later - still hungery. Contact the restaraunt and order is still there and to get a refund you have to call Uber Eats. Contact UberEats for refund - they offered me a $4 credit for $12 worth of food. Didn't want that exchange and was told that my request was too complicated and another group would have to contat me via email in a day or so. Horrible Service all the way around.

"I drove for Uber Eats on the 17th of August 2022. I completed 4 trips and gas is $4 a gallon. When accepting the trip it states what you will be getting paid including tip. After completing the trips, it states that after 1 hour the funds would go to your virtual wallet. 24hrs later I have not received my tips for the trips I completed. When calling Uber Eats customer service, I was transferred 5 times on 17 August, and 6 times 18 August. I have spoken to 11 different people. It's impossible to drive and not be compensated for wear, fuel, and time, while Uber collects their 25% and the driver nothing. This is shameful and beneath fair business practices.

"I received an order coupon for $40, I later ordered that day. Trying to place my order I am only to find out over an hour later that it I am ineligible for this promotion. The Uber Eats Rep tells me through the chat that it's a glitch in the system and to place the order and they will credit the charge back. I should have figured out that this was going to be a problem when they disconnected and I could no longet get ahold of anyone on their support CHAT. I call up their customer service phone number trying to explain only to be rudely interrupted by the Customer service agent with a terrible phone manner and ultimately hung up on.

I call back and the next person hangs up on me after asking to speak to management.

The same thing happens a third time. I did actually get through to someone who was competent and listened to the feedback, but after three hangups and incorrect information from their reps.

This could be easily remedied with an automated script, but they don't even do that. Shameful customer service.

Three days later they send me a $15 dollar refund. In the middle of the night so I would not respond.
Calling back in the moring, speaking to Felicia, she indicated it was a %40 off coupon. Which it wasn't. After more time waisted Felicia did correct this problem.

I WILL NEVER USE UBER EATS, I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I SEND MY HOURLY BILL FOR WAISTING MY TIME.

"Completely wrong order more than $60 dollars and to be treated as I was trying to get a refund to get free money after having 35 orders on my account and from those 35 times I have ordered with Uber 4 of those I have made a complaint and 1 of those was a time where my food was stolen directly from the driver making the deliver so what I get is a customer cannot make a complaint more than 3 times in there account or complaints on a order where the order is more than $60 dollars and up because the account is flagged out. What kind of service is this? What kind of system
Is this? Uber eats saids they prioritizes there customers that's a complete lie and today was the day I experienced that after hearing all of my friends and family saying the same thing over and over again about there customer service now I didn't want to believe or expected that my account one day was going to to be flagged out and block to receive a refund in the future even though showing proof of wrong deliver or order received. It is unbelievable for me but Oh well guess I will be moving forward with making another competidor deliver app my new priority when choosing a delivery service Uber eats u lost a very loyal customer and I will be running to tell everyone I know how you guys and your system operates. Greedy system all for $$$$$ give me, give, give me system and $#*! off to the customer when it comes with dealing with a real problem…

"I agree with many people here; it is absolutely the worst customer service ever! I will say that they used to be good, responsive and extremely helpful. As of late, something has changed, and I'm so glad that I do not pay for Uber One. On February 5, I created a group order, and an item was left off of one of my coworker's orders. I submitted a ticket, and the usual, I was told that someone was looking into it. A week later, I checked on the status and received the same response. Two weeks later, I check the status, and the ticket was archived stating that a resolution had been reached. I resubmitted the ticket, and I was told they were aware of the issue and working to fix it. I asked what was the holdup, that it had been over two weeks. I stated this was very unprofessional and unfair to the person who did not receive the order she paid for. I was told they escalated the issue and are working hard to find a solution. I guess if this is an escalated issue, everyone in that department must be dead, because there has not been a resolution, and they previously tried to close the case without resolving the issue. True, it is only $4 and some change, but it is the principle of the matter that gives me pause... Uber, you really need to work on this, as your ratings on several sites are reflective of the level of service you have provided.

"I have never had a more insane experience with food delivery as with Uber Eats in Pleasanton California. I would not recommend anyone order through the app in this town - use Door Dash or anything else! Not long ago I purchased over $80 from a very reputable restaurant only to never receive my order, when I finally got ahold of someone on the help line she told me the order had been delivered already and the driver left a note that they couldn't get through my apartment gate so they left it on the road outside. She told me she was sorry for my ""frustration"" but couldn't do anything because the order said it was ""delivered"". I fought with Uber Eats for two days afterward and was finally refunded - only to find out that they had tipped the driver some $24 dollars from my account that I did not authorize, and failed to refund me! The driver didn't make one attempt to contact me when all that happened, just dumped the food on the side of the road, and somehow got a $24 tip? More recently I ordered a simple burrito bowl from Chipotle through Uber Eats and asked for steak with lettuce, and salsa, no rice. I got about 5 sprigs of lettuce, a giant scoop of guacamole and sour cream and no steak... I figured I'd just be done with Uber Eats, it was only a $12 bowl and the delivery fee was only 49 cents...then I got an email showing that I was charged $25.60. I immediately took a picture and chatted with Cate who told me she would escalate this to management and I need not do anything more, they will contact me via email. Well 48 hours later they sent me two identical emails telling me they are sorry for my ""frustration"" but cannot refund me -- all I asked for was an adjustment given the fact that I didn't even get what I ordered! I wrote them a second time and received the exact same message. ""Frustration"" doesn't even cut it. They are, Needless to say, I'll never use Uber Eats in this area again and will steer everyone i know away from using that service here. The quality control is non-existent and the time it takes to get your money back is completely unacceptable. Do yourself a favor and, at least in Pleasanton/Dublin California, delete the Uber Eats App and don't look back.

"I private messaged Uber on FB, to speak to a manager. I was asked why, I answered politely, and was ignored even though I was promised a call last week. They also ignore me on twitter. Uber has the worst customer service, a rep refused to give me a refund for an order I never received, because I didn't phrase my sentence exactly how she wanted me to, then she ended the chat. The system reassigned me to her because when it asked if I was helped I said no. So she changed her name from Asna to a dot (.) and proceeded to ignore me, and eventually ended the chat. So, I called and the rep kept pretending he couldn't hear me, and hung up. He called back, stayed silent and hung up. My last driver refused to drop off my order at the door, and just left. The driver before that dropped of the wrong order, it was a huge order, it took me hours to get a rep on the phone for a refund. The driver apparently never answered their call, so they couldn't figure what happened to my huge order. I've been asking them for a call back to help me with the Uber ride app, but they just ignore my messages.

I was given the run around; first they don't process refunds after 48 hours. I don't want a refund, I never received an order, it was a cancellation. Second, I had too many attempts to get my money back on the order when it was my FIRST TIME EVER reaching out to them for help for anything UBER/UBER EATS related. Third, I had too many attempts on my account alone. That was just it for me at that point. I will NOT order from UBER EATS ever again. They give you crappy service while taking your money.

"No one ever use uber eats. What a terrible terrible service. Due to my knee injury I can't drive and it's hard for me to make dinner. So I decided to try uber eats for the first time. BIG MISTAKE! My sons burger was missing, so I try to reach support through the app to no avail, no one responding. So I call McDonald's and they say there's nothing they can do I have to get a refund through the app then reorder to get his burger to him. I google uber eats phone number since I can't get a hold of anyone on the app and have been told my account is restricted and I can't get a refund. I say why and the guy says I don't know. I say I'm injured how is my child going to get his burger? And he says he can't help with that or give me a refund. So I say I don't want a refund then I want the burger can someone just deliver the burger, he comes back saying the delivery driver won't deliver again for free and I would have to reorder the burger (that I already paid for) and pay all the fees again in order to get it delivered. Now I'm feeling extremely frustrated as my injury has caused me to be couch ridden and all I'm trying to do is feed my child so, I ask for a manager and he says one will call me back in 4-10 hours. What a joke. Of course I gave my son my burger, but I'm still hungry and can't move I'm going back to skip the dishes, at least they help when I call support.

I went back upstairs and contacted Uber by phone. I informed the customer service rep that I had not recieved my order. According to the rep, the driver is supposed to take a photo of where the order was left, I was told that there was no photo. The rep placed me on hold to contact rhe driver. The driver did not answer. The rep informed me that he left the driver a msg to contact me regarding the delivery. 2 hours later, NO call from the driver. I was told that I may recieve a refund 24-48 hours later, AFTER an investigation. I told them to delete my account.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! USE DOORDASH IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FOOD BECAUSE THEY DON'T ISSUE REFUNDS!,"February 4th, 2023",1,Rachel I.,sitejabber,,
"Unfortunately I have to give them one star. They are the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life with any app. They charged me $17.13 for canceling an order and then proceeded to charge me over $23 for the whole entire order! When I tried to get customer service help she told me that the order had already gone through and that because the merchant has started making it in under 3 minutes before I canceled my order I was still charged! There was absolutely no help whatsoever. This is the worst app ever! I tried to get in touch with them last night when I cancelled it and they charged me but no one helped me. I then tried to contact them again this morning to no avail. They are the worst company and I hope they go out of business. I really really really really hope they go out of business seeing as how they have very little stars from almost every customer that I have read about on the reviews. Poor $#*!ty customer service! There is no phone number to contact them and why would there be with so many customer complaints. No wonder nobody wants to pick up the phone or have a phone number for their customers to call them to dispute any transactions or charges that are outrageous! I hope people in the future before they download Uber eats will read the reviews beforehand so that they don't get charged outrageous canceling prices! They are absolutely ridiculous, absurd, the most obtuse people! I hate this app! I hate that company! And I'm disputing the charge with my bank. Like I said before I really hope they go out of business! That's the very least that they deserve. I hope they get sued and I hope all the bad things come to them! I'm not letting this go! I'm going to get back my money one way or the other! They care more about the merchant then they do the customers. It shouldn't cost over $23 to cancel an order. That is insane! All bad things to them! All bad things! $#*!S!
Tip for consumers:
Don't use it! Don't download it! You will be extremely disappointed with their customer service and the wait time for your order to be delivered if it's still delivered hot or cold depending on what you order. Mine usually comes to me for cold stuff melted and for hot stuff luke warm to damn near Cold! Absolutely worst worst app in the entire world. Absolutely worst customer service!

"The customer service at Uber eats is the worst I've ever had to deal with. Whether it's them not willing to cancel my order because the order was going to take seven hours to be delivered, not delivering my order to the correct house or just recently putting my order on a Windowsill which fell behind my bushes and then I too fell in the bushes while trying to get the food.

I go in app and see the promotion has disappeared. I reach out to customer service via chat and I was told if I am not able to provide a picture of the promotion, nothing can be done.

"I've been ordering from ubereats for years, frequently, and my last order had a missing item. So I let customer service know, and they said I can't get a refund because my account has a temporary hold on refunds. Absolutely no reason, clarification, or estimate on when refunds will be allowed on my account again. The service has been awful at responding to my questions and just gives the same automated message. What a horrible way to treat a long time customer. My trust is broken. How can I trust this service if they don't allow refunds when an item is missing?

I made an order last evening and it was delivered and sealed tight it looked right but couldn't open it in front of the driver gave the code. Then when I opened it it wasn't my good, nothing that I ordered was inside, the restaurant had given me different items. No one ever called me to tell me, or ask my permission, no th y just did it, delivered it and we'll never gave my money back. Last thing week the items delivered from a different restaurant were also wrong and again they said it was nonrefundable. Well that isn't good enough, if you get the wrong items then they should be replaced or refunded. This is Ubers problem should not be mine.

"What a rip off this company is. I was ordering food and I accidentally hit the order button instead of the leave button. I corrected the mistake within 20 seconds and canceled the order. The restaurant I was ordering from was not even open yet. However I was charged through my account when I contacted Uber and the vendor I was told by the vendor I would have a refund within 48 hours so I waited no refund, I called Uber and they told me pretty much too bad too sad you waited too long to contact us so therefore we're not giving you your money back. What kind of business would do that? Why are we subjected to pay money that we don't owe from a company who I have used numerous times, this policy sucks and I will never ever ever order through them again. Instacart here we come. Between myself and my family we have probably ordered thousands of dollars worth of groceries or food over the last four years and they're willing to give up a good customer for $14.70

Yes. I told them specifically where to meet me and they refused or couldn't find it.

Did the delivery partner try to contact you?:
Yes, but I told them I am on a computer and couldn't answer the phone. We were texting and they actively cancelled as I was responding.

Does your order appear as delivered or cancelled in the app?:
It says completed. I never received my order and I do expect a full refund.

Details:
I told them SPECIFICALLY where to meet me. They did not meet me there, took my food and cancelled my order.

Driver was Brandy, drives a Hyundai Elantra. Number is *******614. They did not answer any calls. They tried to contact me by calling and hanging up before I could answer. They are probably eating my damn food right now. Do Uber Eats drivers not see the location the buyer sets for them to drop the food off? Do they have an IQ of 0? Awful business.

"Ordered off lunch menu. I waited an hour. Uber eats picked up order, gets 5 mins from my house and then cancelled the order. Now the lunch menu is over for that restaurant. If I want to reorder the same exact food it will cost me $92, compared to my original order of $49. Sure it will be larger portions, but I don't need large portions for my lunch and go out of town tomorrow, so leftover's aren't an option either. Just really sucks. Uber headquarters from India called to tell me the order was canceled and I explained my side and he literally said ""you will have to contact customer service, bye bye"" (with an extremely rude annoying tone) and then hung up on me.

"For a few months, I had a monthly membership that was $9.99/m. Out of no where, I was charged $60 for an annual membership(this was in July 2023). I never changed or canceled my monthly membership, nor authorized to be charged for the annual membership. I chocked it up to a glitch, contacted customer service, and they refunded me. I continued my monthly membership for 9.99 for a month, then decided to cancel it all together, because I wasn't using it enough to justify paying for it. Woke up today to a 14.99 charge from UberOne on my bank account. [Follow along, because this get confusing]. Contacted customer service, asked for a cancellation and refund. I was told because I had already been refunded in the past(that annual membership I never signed up for), that they wouldn't refund me. So I asked why it was 14.99 instead of the monthly 9.99, he told me it was for a 3-month membership and I was ""only charged 14.99 instead of the standard 30 for three months"" as if I should be appreciative. He then explained it as ""You canceled the annual membership, but kept your monthly membership, so you were charged for a 3 month membership."" EXPLAIN to me how that makes sense. I never should have been charged for the annual. I shouldn't have been charged for the 3 months, after canceling it all together. And I shouldn't have been charged for 3 months PERIOD because I never signed up for it. He and I went around in circles for 15 minutes then he hung up the chat. The entire thing makes no sense; I'm out $15 now. I'm taking my card off their app and will NEVER, EVER order using them again. This is literally theft.

Your rep tells me there will be no refund of the $120.00 stolen from me in little more than a month, as those transactions are more than 48 hours old.

Uber eats tried to offer me UBER CASH but I REFUSED because that's not how I paid for my order! I paid for my order with MY HARD EARNED MONEY! I didn't pay with Uber cash!

"I order many times from Uber Eats and just had a problem on my last order regarding the Tip.
Whenever I place an order, i remove the Tip and give the Deliver person a Cash tip. For this order, I gave the Delivery person $5.00 when they delivery my order.

Well, the next day I got an email from Uber Eats and they are charging me an additional tip for $5.07,

I called their customer service and spoke for about 45 minutes with a person named Zarah, and she told me that I will receive an email regarding my issue after we speak. She could not give me back a credit for the Charged Tip and I was told I will recieve an email the next day. Well, I didn't receive any emails so I called back today and was told the same thing by another customer representative named Maya. I got the ""Run-Around"".

I can't believe this company is dishonest and with no integrity and have no regards for their customers. I usually order about six times a month but I will not longer place an order with them.

I don't like being ripped off and their App will be deleted from my mobile.

"For a few months, I had a monthly membership that was $9.99/m. Out of no where, I was charged $60 for an annual membership(this was in July 2023). I never changed or canceled my monthly membership, nor authorized to be charged for the annual membership. I chocked it up to a glitch, contacted customer service, and they refunded me. I continued my monthly membership for 9.99 for a month, then decided to cancel it all together, because I wasn't using it enough to justify paying for it. Woke up today to a 14.99 charge from UberOne on my bank account. [Follow along, because this get confusing]. Contacted customer service, asked for a cancellation and refund. I was told because I had already been refunded in the past(that annual membership I never signed up for), that they wouldn't refund me. So I asked why it was 14.99 instead of the monthly 9.99, he told me it was for a 3-month membership and I was ""only charged 14.99 instead of the standard 30 for three months"" as if I should be appreciative. He then explained it as ""You canceled the annual membership, but kept your monthly membership, so you were charged for a 3 month membership."" EXPLAIN to me how that makes sense. I never should have been charged for the annual. I shouldn't have been charged for the 3 months, after canceling it all together. And I shouldn't have been charged for 3 months PERIOD because I never signed up for it. He and I went around in circles for 15 minutes then he hung up the chat. The entire thing makes no sense; I'm out $15 now. I'm taking my card off their app and will NEVER, EVER order using them again. This is literally theft.

"I have just gotten off the phone with your support staff. 3 times in one week, I was overcharged, not receiving the 2 for 1 discount advertised for Sunny Jims in Pittsburgh, PA. After finding this, I went back and found I have been overcharged TWELVE TIMES from Sunny Jims since August 2,2023, not once getting the 2 for 1 promotion price. If you look at my account you will see I use your service 7 days a week, sometimes twice in one day. Your rep tells me there will be no refund of the $120.00 stolen from me in little more than a month, as those transactions are more than 48 hours old. It appears that Uber may be doing this intentionally to steal from a loyal customer. Is this how you reward me for spending thousands of dollars with Uber? The last insult was the rep I chatted to refusing to send me higher up the chain of command.

Thoroughly disgusted

"I placed an order on 01/14/2022 for Bed bath and beyond, order #567C9. I received few damaged, wrong, and missing items. So the WHOLE order was messed up! I complained to Uber eats customer service and they said I wasn't eligible for a refund! How? I've only had 2 previous refunds! I'm guessing they're counting the fact that I had 2 other orders that were CANCELLED by UBER because the store was out of stock! So they can't hold that against me since they were the ones to cancel! Uber eats tried to offer me UBER CASH but I REFUSED because that's not how I paid for my order! I paid for my order with MY HARD EARNED MONEY! I didn't pay with Uber cash! SO I EXPECT MY REFUND BACK TO MY ORIGINAL FORM OF PAYMENT! Uber eats wants to give me Uber cash so I can spend the money with them again instead of refunding me by my original form of payment. THIS IS FRAUD AND THEFT! They want to wrongfully keep my money by any means possible! How is it I'm eligible for Uber cash but not to my original form of payment? Because Uber knows they in the wrong and they don't want to do right by the customer! UBER EATS IS A FRAUDULENT COMPANY AND IS REFUSING TO REFUND ME!

"The driver confirmed a grocery collection and then didn't move on the tracker for over an hour! It looks like the driver was outside their home, as it is residential street and not road that would have traffic on it for OVER AN HOUR!
Messaged the driver, no response! Called uber eats support, got passed round to 4 different people having to repeat my same problem only for them to put the phone down on me! They then called me back and hung up on me, as soon as answered. (Was in ""great"" signal area). The offer of a £5 credit is unsatisfactory for the service received today. Really unhappy and not what I expect. I want someone from the Uber eats team to contact me immediately.

"I would not recommend Uber Eat. I live in Manchester and the service here is poor. It was very often I missed some items from my order. Anyway my money was refunded. But not last time. My order was delivered to the wrong address, I could see it on photo, provided by driver. He left the order outside the door. I have never selected the option to leave my order outside. I was always waiting. The driver tried to contact me, I sent him a message to remind my address.
The Uber Eat customer team decided that I was eligible for a refund. I sent them the picture, made by a driver. But they somehow refunded me a half an order. I sent them emails and every time different agent respond and every time differently. It is not possible to contact Uber team and you'll hardly find a complaint section. I only could get a webchat. My issue still not resolved.
I will never order again by Uber Eat.
If you have an option to order strait from restaurants or supermarkets do it, it is cheaper and less stressful. Anyway, if you decided to order from Uber Eats, I recommend: make screenshots of the cost (how it looks first time) and items on your order, the time your order takes, try to contact a driver by message and take screenshots. If a driver making a picture - you need to save it. All of that it you will need to provide as an evidence for customer team. Or your money will never be refunded. Hope my review is helpful

She ordered some place else. 2 days later she sees two charges on credit card statements, called Uber eats, they blame my mother for not calling earlier, neither did they send any receipt, for my mom to know she was charged. Bottom line very poor customer service, not willing to listen and satisfy a customer. Unless, we consumers start using alternatives do these companies realize, customer satisfaction is of upmost importance and profits come secondary…, after this experience our family and friends are boycotting Uber eats!

"My first experience using ubereats delivering an order from LA herradura will be my first and last. Our driver Isaac had at some point while waiting on our food so he said...sent us a text saying that he was at the restaurant... they were running behind...the food would be up shortly... they were just busy for the weekend. When we got the food we were missing over half of our order... the food was extremely cold and drenched from the juices...so soggy. We called the restaurant and I actually spoke to the person who said he specifically packaged our food and handed our driver two bags not one... And he then went on to say that our driver was late he was not on time. When we called customer support she looked up the status and it did show that he was late picking up the food, so why did he lie to us in the text? And his name was Isaac maybe you should have a discussion with him... She then went on to explain that they do not send another driver to pick up the difference of our food or replace the rest of it as well but I would only get a refund for what we were missing. Not only that she then went on to say that she was going to give a $40 credit on the Uber's cash along with the refund to my bank account.
So then I wake up this morning to go on to my account and the Uber cash has now been lowered to $23 wow who does that?
Great way of taking care of your guests and resolving issues... Never again... Our order was initially over $100 by the time the service fee the delivery fee and our generous tip it then came to $118...
When I asked how to lower the tip to go back and adjust it she told me to go to my orders on my Uber account nowhere on there does it show that you can adjust the tip once it has went through... Another lie I'm assuming.
Thanks for the worst first experience ever ordering food and having it delivered...

"I am a regular customer of Uber DoorDash and Skip the dishes the worst experience was with Uber and the worst thing is their customer service people they have one sentence to tell you and they repeated it like robots not humans so you feel like you are talking to a ""wall"" they are not even able to give an explanation you ask for a supervisor they tell you oh he is busy and he will call you later but you receive no call at all. I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I'm not lying when I say...Uber eats has the worst drivers and customer service when there is a problem. I rarely have issues with door dash but with uber eats 9 out of 10 times there is an issue. Either delivery to the wrong address or a missing item or missing half the order. I realize you don't need a high education to deliver goods, but some common sense would help. For uber eats, a way to refund a customer if a restaraunt doesn't have an item or they forget to put it in. Uber eats had the audacity to send me an email stating I had too many requests for refunds and they would no longer refund me. How is an error made by the restaraunt or the driver, the customers fault? They told me to rate the restaraunt as the remedy for missing items. Ok...I can do that, but who is going to refund my money? Many times I had to go to the restaraunt or call them to tell them I didn't get items. They never issue a refund because they don't have the card there. Most times they tell you ""next time you come in we will give you the item"". Ha! Ridiculous! Defeats the purpose of getting food delivered if you have to solve the issue and go pick up item later...what if a disabled or elderly person couldn't go get it? The restaraunt keeps your money and uber basically tells you to piss off and blames YOU, the customer. This is the worst customer service to operate like that! Do yourself a favor... bypass the headache and join door dash!

"My address was incorrectly inputted, I immediately went to change it on the order. ""It's too late to change your address!"" the website tells me. Really? Too late? A minute after I put it in, a driver hasn't been assigned and it's too late? I'll just call customer support--

Thirty minutes later and my sixth CS person, they tell me they can't. Thirty minutes and six: ""we're sending you to a team better able to handle this issue!"" to tell me they can't? Then why does the website recommend calling customer support?

So what did they tell me: contact the driver. I would, but the number on the account is old -- and apparently you can't change that either! Amazing. Can't CS do it? Nope! Can't change my freaking number!

While this was happening, I sent the driver three messages. None of them were read, opened, responded to. The food was dropped off in some random parking lot and labelled as ""Complete!""

The driver has a little bit of the blame for not bothering to even look at the messages, I have a bit of the blame for not double checking the address, Uber has a huge amount of the blame for making the slightest of issues take forever to (not) resolve!

"Ubereats - you pay for food you never receive AND food you’ve never ordered. Plus they have awful customer service and refuse refund claims. First of all the restaurant they offer (Honest Burger) are a bunch of scammers. There’s always something missing from the order. When you do the food delivery and don’t have the item you order, you can’t just go to the store and claim they send you to Ubereats. Not only that but you are left with no food. You’re charged for nothing and Uber REFUSED to give me a refund. That’s a scam. And the attitude of the uber agent I contacted was also disgusting and very defensive rather than being compassionate.

After a 45 minute phone call we were told that cancelling the order would still be chargeable.

No matter if you order food, which will probably end up somewhere in the neighborhood, or if you order groceries from a store, you won’t get what you order.

My partner sent screenshots of the drive way and street to show him where we were but he had driven so far up the estate and just refused to turn around. Claimed he was outside, and said ‘come collect the food’ - this is during a phone call with my partner to which my partner said ‘you aren’t outside my house, I’ve been standing outside, in the rain waiting for you’. Driver hung up on him, marked the meal as delivered and then…drove past our house to leave the estate!!. Called the ‘specialists’ waited on hold for 20 minutes to be told that ‘because it has been marked as delivered and the driver attempted contact, no refund can be issued’.

"Disrespectful delivery drivers and help staff. Refused to give me a refund as driver “followed their policy” Driver Supposedly “Delivered” to myself but I didn’t get anything. Gave the address of where I was, but they delivered to another location 5-7 minutes down the road! Telling them I was pregnant, didn’t drive to work because of being 8 months and doing your last week of work before MAT leave begins. Didn’t care, just got blame with 2 different excuses -1. I must have had my notifications turned off on the app.. which I didn’t - how did I know to contact the driver at 14:32 when it was to be estimated for 14:25 (but still not with me) driver waited 7 minutes after declaring they were unable to find address to then message me on the app (their policy - may I add says they wait 7 minutes and contact you at time of arrival to destination, before marking as delivered even if it isn’t) the policy is not to message a customer 7 minutes after waiting and not contacting them to say they can’t find address and that the road says “road closed” when he was nowhere near the input address. Marks it as delivered anyway..2. The other blame was to say to check my address is correct before submitting order - which I did- my address was correct. I proved this by sending a screenshot of both the chat and location of where I was, and where drive was when marking it completed. Showed the address I put in and the one where he delivered to..After requesting a refund, I was told I’m not eligible with those excuses, so I asked for a manager and then when this happens.. the operator “Ali” blocked me from using Uber eats completely.no longer able to contact the help desk or use the app to order food. I did nothing wrong, showed evidence it was the driver who went to the wrong address, that wasn’t given and then how he was rude about not being able to it, to then get treated with the upmost disrespectful “help desk operator”. I paid £16 for a single Mc Donald’s select meal including delivery and service.. and to then not get one of the most expensive meals I’ve ever got from Mc Donald’s, it’s a joke!

"Uber eats Ok.  I am actually tired of all the wrong orderes being recieved.  As the issue should be with the individual merchant this complaint against Uber Eats is because they penalize customers when merchants gets something wrong.  To elaborate, recently, Jan 6, 2024 order placed and one item was not received, but rather a completely different item.  A picture was taken and sent to UE.  1- not only did they NOT respond within the 48 hrs but instead, 13 days later!, they said the food was picked up and no refund will be given. First, 13 days later is unacceptable.  Second, the order was NEVER picked up it was delivered.  Third, how dare you penalize the customer and let the merchant just get away with getting the order wrong.  This is wrong and flat out an unacceptable business model.  I assure you if you punish the merchant when appropriate like getting orders wrong, then I’m sure they will start reading the orders correctly.  Keep my money that you stole from me and other customers, Mr Merchant and Uber Eats.  I’m not in need of that, you are.  I am happy to continue to post everywhere I can about your flawed business and lack of respect for customers.

"I make many orders from UberEATS, but in the past few months, when I am missing an item in my order, they are not getting back to me, or it takes weeks to hear something back from their customer service support team in the app. Postmates was the app I used to use. They bought the company. An order was made on January 6, 2024, and they returned to me on January 19, 2024, at 7:00 AM. I ordered with Subway, and one of my items was not delivered. After I didn’t hear back from UberEATS in two hours, I contacted the store, and they said they ran out of oatmeal cookies and I needed to contact UberEATS for a refund. The store should’ve got me and given me another option or cancel the order, but they didn’t. I contacted UberEATS, and now, 12 days later, they refuse to give me a refund because they said after the investigation, they can’t confirm I didn’t receive my order of oatmeal cookies.  Please know I spend around $300.00 a week with UberEATS. I had a drink missing from another order, and they refused to refund me.  UberEATS has to understand when you have a customer who orders a lot, and they likely will have more requests for refunds or complaints about missing items. UberEATS owes me about $159.00 in five months on missing items; they refund to give me credit or refund back to my credit cards—UberEATS is not customer friendly.","Date of experience: January 06, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tyrone Hill,Trust Pilot,,

It can take a considerable amount of time to source another driver and Uber won’t let you cancel or give a full refund. They will tell you the food is kept in insulated bags. It isn’t. And anyway, sitting around does nothing for the quality of the food which is unfair on the restaurant who spent time preparing it.What’s more irritating is that Uber won’t do anything about it so you end up with a delivery of freezing cold fast food when it’s minus 3 in January that even the dog won’t touch.

I struggled with the app as it required me to apply a verification before the order could be sent out. The driver sent message no hot chocolate . I advised milk. the order arrived late and cold as well as missing the entire kids wonka pancakes meal. I was notified I was to get a credit for being late. I then sent in I was missing the meal. After I wrote a bad review my bill was then updates to a higher amount. Not only did they take the entire 50 gift card balance. Ubereats charged my debit card 14 something as well as the tip . for grand total of 71 and some change. Not only did they not credit me for late cold food. they over charged me . after numerous frustrating messages back and forth. customer service is useless. they credited my credit card for the 11 and change for the meal.

I finally got in touch with their team via email through their website and they offered no help. They kept claiming I cancelled the order myself which is why they could not refund me even though I sent screenshot PROOF of the app saying Uber Eats cancelled my order. I had to send the screenshot multiple times and they still ignored the facts, so that they could take my money even though they had not delivered. A company cannot charge a customer for goods/services not delivered when it’s no fault of the customer. At one point they said they charged me for the restaurant and drivers time, when THEY had cancelled the order?! If anyone should be charged for anyone’s time Uber Eats should be charged for wasting mine and for taking my money and delivering nothing. I have still not been refunded and they have stopped responding so that they don’t have to refund me, so reporting this here. I have seen online that this has been an issue for many and is completely unacceptable. I will keep reporting about this, urging everyone everywhere not to use Uber Eats as they may simply lose their money and get nothing in return, and attempt to claim back the money from Uber Eats through my bank instead. I have never ever heard of a company fully charging customers when no goods/services are delivered and the fault is 100% their own. Incredible.","Date of experience: January 16, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CL,Trust Pilot,,

Ordered a meal through macdonalds app and order number was through uber. Got the wrong order!! Uber said refund would take 15 days. Month later still not received. Fobbed me off telling me I had to ring the store and i said the store doesn't issue refunds. 2 further calls to uber who told me I had to contact macdonalds. Done this and  mcdonalds told me I had to contact uber. Tried again and the number only accepts current orders not past. So no refund as too stressful to keep ringing different numbers.

"I can’t use UberEats anymore. I pay for priority delivery, and because my address is at the bottom of town your drivers act like they have not picked up my food. So it looks like it’s waiting for a rider to pick up. But actually, they have already got it, but not notified the app so they can then deliver someone else’s food before mine. By the time I get it, it’s cold. I like to cook food at home with some orders, but I can’t cook anything as I don’t know when my food will arrive. In some cases it’s turning up a whole 30 minutes whilst it is still waiting to be collected. It’s outrageous, priority delivery isn’t a real thing.

"UberEats itself is a wonderful concept and great app, but their customer service is seriously lacking. I have placed several orders where several items have been missing, and when I call Uber Eats to report the missing food, the only response I have gotten was that I would be refunded for the items. That's great and all, but what do I do with the people who have nothing to eat because they didn't receive their order??? Why is it not in the policy to contact the restaurant and ask them to deliver the missing food items??? Last night my family and I ordered over $100 worth of food for dinner. After an hour, my son was literally crying because he was hungry. The time for delivery kept extending later and later. I received a phone call from the restaurant itself. Apparently the driver picked up the wrong food. He said he would be contacting Uber and they would contact me. Another 10-15 minutes went by before I finally heard from Uber. The woman who called me from Uber spoke barely any English and was extremely difficult to understand. She informed me that my order had been canceled, I would be refunded, and if I wanted, I could go back to the app and place another order. I was confused by this. S instead of just figuring out the mix-up with the driver and getting me the correct food, I had to place another order and wait ANOTHER hour?!?!?! As I was asking the woman to clarify why that needed to be done, she literally began to talk over me, as if I was not even speaking. Then she tried to dismiss me and end the call and I asked her to wait because I still had questions. She again ignored me and spoke over me and then hung up on me! Let me make this clear: SHE HUNG UP ON A CUSTOMER WHO WAS ASKING FOR HELP IN CLARIFYING THE SITUATION!!! As someone who has worked in customer service for over 15 years, I found this absolutely unacceptable. When a situation like this mix-up happens, which I was completely understanding of and not at all irate, a customer service representative should have been kind and apologetic, offering solutions and listening to any questions I might have, NOT talk over me, ignore me, and then hang up on me.To make matters worse, I called Uber Customer Service to complain about this rude representative, and the woman I spoke to at that time was very kind and helpful, and she apologized for the other representative, and told me that a supervisor would be calling me later on in the evening. I asked her if they would be calling me that same night and she said yes. Well, here it is, the next day, and my phone has yet to ring. So Uber Eats itself is great.

"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received from Uber Eats, specifically regarding an order I placed with Soi Thai in Clapham. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of appalling.After purchasing a meal through Uber Eats from Soi Thai, I suffered from a severe case of food poisoning. Distressed by this, I promptly contacted Uber Eats seeking assistance and resolution to this health hazard. To my dismay, the response I received was both unhelpful and dismissive.The lack of concern and assistance displayed by Uber Eats in handling such a critical issue is utterly unacceptable. As a customer, I expected a responsible and prompt resolution to ensure the safety of all patrons. The refusal to address my concerns is indicative of a poor commitment to customer welfare and highlights the inadequacy of Uber Eats in managing food quality issues.Considering the severity of the matter, I feel compelled to report this incident to the relevant health and safety authorities. It is disheartening that such a trusted platform as Uber Eats fails to take responsibility for the potential health risks posed by its affiliated restaurants.I strongly urge Uber Eats to reevaluate its customer service protocols and prioritize the health and safety of its patrons. Neglecting such issues not only tarnishes the reputation of your service but also poses serious risks to the well-being of your customers.This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied and concerned about the standards upheld by Uber Eats. I hope that steps will be taken to rectify these issues promptly.","Date of experience: January 10, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wioleta,Trust Pilot,,

"I am a longtime customer. I have been ordering takeaways and groceries from them for years. Today is my last day as a customer. After my experience this evening, I would rather walk through snow barefoot to pick up my food, because that would feel more pleasant than dealing with Ubereat’s robot customer service.My order never arrived, I have evidence on my door camera and concierge downstairs, no sighting of a delivery driver.The delivery driver never contacted me and left the food out at a random building (with a blurry photo of the food next to a concrete wall…who knows where).I never got any notifications from the driver regarding issues in finding my apartmentI had even ordered another item earlier in the day (and many times of the past few years) with no issues. I have never had a driver not be able to locate my current apartment. I make the instructions clear, keep my phone near me and always have my notifications on.Ubereats sided with the driver, despite no evidence of them delivering the food to me or contacting me. And I got charged for the food…unbelievable!This is apparently common practice as some ubereats drivers just can’t be bothered, wait outside a random location and claim to have tried to contact you and just take a photo of it next to a random wall (and it’s nowhere near where you actually live). And UberEats will side with the driver because they wait the amount of time needed for whatever aweful policy they have to charge the customer.Go with Deliveroo - this never happens with them.Ubereats used to be a great business - it’s a shame their automated customer service and policies don’t side with customers. It seems silly as there are so many other great providers and competition on the market.","Date of experience: January 09, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KS,Trust Pilot,,

"I had placed an order from UberEats and gave instructions for the delivery driver to come to the front of my building as many will, for whatever reason, go to the back.  My driver sent me a text saying he was here and I told him I was at the front, even mentioning that there were instructions for him to go there.  Instead of driving to the front of the building, he walked my food - in the middle of cold (-8 C) weather - to the front.  Because my building is large, my order was cold and inedible.  I contacted customer service via the app 4 times and all 4 times was disconnected without resolution.  I had requested a refund or a credit in the amount of my order, but they refused; stating it was against their policy to do so.  The last agent I was chatting with at least offered to have a supervisor call me back.The supervisor, Angel, did call me at 1 in the morning.  He kept cutting me off when I tried to explain the issue and then proceeded to get upset because I raised my voice.  I told him I had been in customer service for years and have offered full credit whenever an issue arose, which was rare. I will admit, I did curse at him, but this was after him not understanding the situation that they technically stole money from me as I was unable to have my meal.

I waited patiently, but there was no sign of the delivery driver. Strangely, the app indicated that my order had been successfully delivered, which is far from the truth. This has left me both frustrated and inconvenienced.What adds to my dismay is that I was charged for the undelivered order. I find it utterly unacceptable to be charged for a service that was not rendered as expected. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution. I request a refund for the full amount charged for my order.I understand that unforeseen circumstances may occur, but communication is key. A simple notification or explanation for the delay or non-delivery would have been appreciated.I urge you to take swift action in rectifying this issue to restore my trust in Uber Eats.

"I'm very dissatisfied with the service I received from Uber Eats. Its been issue after issue and they never seem to resolve anytjing. Most recently, my food was not delivered. I contacted Uber eats and they told me it was not their issue. That I had call the restaurant. Both Uber Eats and the restaurant tried to blame each other, and I never got my money back. Which I don't understand, because this driver is employed by Uber Eats, so it was their problem. They don't care about their customers, all they care about is the money. And that's very evident with their lack of customer service. Its extremely hard to get in contact with anyone, and when you do the customer service is absolute trash.

"I would give zero if I could.  I have ordered from UberEats several times in the last year but a couple of months ago I placed an order and then realised I had missed out a side dish.  I cancelled the first order, called the restaurant to make them aware of it and placed a second larger order with the same restaurant within minutes. The restaurant was aware of it. I have not been refunded for the first order.  Today I have seen an explanation saying that no refund is due because the restaurant had already started preparing the order.  That is total rubbish as the restaurant is one of my regular local places and I simply increased the order and did not change it.  What a bunch of thieves!  They don't even have a complaints procedure I was told after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes for customer services.  I would highly recommend you don't use them.  JustEats is so much more decent. They have a phone line you can call if something goes wrong and a refunds policy.  I am escalating this to my credit card company and will post this more widely on social media.

"Disgusting customer service. Ordered through McDelivery, they couldn’t find a driver and food arrived almost an hour after being prepared. The only resolve they offer is a call centre overseas who read an atrocious script and state “cold food is perfectly acceptable as long as it was delivered”. 53 minutes after food is prepared is not acceptable. Nor does it meet food hygiene standards to reheat. Quality issues too AND items missing that we paid for!!!!! But nobody wants to help. Uber eats says it’s McDonald’s.  McDonald’s says its Uber eats.

"Do not trust them with your card information. I ordered groceries for delivery and never got them due to the delivery person who got an attitude because she didn't follow directions. I went to Ubereats to get my refund for purchases never received. I was at ease at first once I got it back. Shortly after, I got an notification about a pending $77.69 that I didn't spend at all it was actually $55.69  . But obviously due to items not being available it went down. When i got the notification about the $77.69 came through $24.84 came out of my account. Now if anyone knows math I had $15.00 left after $24.84 came out. Add it together it was deducted from the refund. The first person I spoke to put me on hold for 10 minutes, and someone else picked up the call. Everything went left when she tried to discredit the receipts I was able to prove. She wanted to argue and say I was wrong. I called back a little later and someone actually did try to help get this resolved. Keep in mind all my information is private and no one else outside of me had it. There is a investigation into my missing funds and with the transactions as well. I won't be using this company ever again. It is beyond sickening how they treat customers using their services.

I contacted McDonald’s and they said I had to contact Uber Eats for a refund. I contacted Uber Eats and they were so rude. They said it didn’t matter that the driver had parked up for 10 minutes to do his shopping because the food arrived before the deadline.

"I tried to order with Uber Eats on Dec 27th, 2023 for the first time and wanted to use the Coupon that I received for $30 off for the first order with FIRSTEATS30 that expired on Dec 31st 2023.When going to the checkout, Uber Eats automatically applied an offer for “no delivery fee” instead of the coupon for $30 off. We tried several times to apply the $30 off coupon code and each time, Uber Eats applied the free delivery offer instead. This is called bait and switch and is illegal. There was no way to opt out of the no delivery fee offer.  I wanted to document that and tried taking a screenshot. By accident I placed the order for the full price, with no $30 discount. I called the restaurant immediately to stop preparing the dishes. It took me about 3 min to figure out how to cancel the order on the app. Then I started a help chat with 3 different agents Roshinikumar, Manuel and Aamir. All 3 said they are not able to refund and are holding back $51.71 from a $63 order because they claimed that the restaurant has already started to prepare the food.  I informed them that this was not the case. Later, I spoke with another agent on the phone who called up the restaurant and refunded me the “stolen” money. This multi million or maybe even billion business had absolutely crappy customer service and did not stand up to their offer to give $30 off for the first order.I will NEVER EVER recommend this business and NEVER order from them.

"I wish I can give zero stars.Let me start by saying after ordering nearly 500 orders via Uber eats and more than 1000 rides with Uber, I have now deleted my account with them.Today I ordered food for my kids from Greggs. I put the order in at 2.20pm and about 10 min after they say the delivery guy is picking up my order. When it was about 2.45pm I wanted to cancel the order because I can see in the app that the delivery guy has been at the same spot for the last 15min and of course now by the time food now gets to me it cold and not fresh. The ETA time keeps on moving longer and longer. Bare in mind I have a child with learning difficulties who is waiting for his food.By now I got another ETA update which now said that the ETA is at 3.15pm which by now was nearly an hour since I initially made the order. When I initially made the order it said on the app that the estimate delivery was 25min. I now went into the chat app of Uber eats explaining to them the situation and asked for my delivery to be cancelled because it’s taking too long. The Uber eats app is not good at all. You send one message and then they will send you 5 to 6 messages at the same time which does not give you a chance to read all. I saw the message do you want to cancel and I said yes stating my reason and letting them know that the driver has been at the same spot which is not even at the restaurant for more than 20min. I then went through the thread and saw due to me cancelling they are charging me about £19. The food that I ordered was £20. These people whoever dealt with my case has no shame. After they took my money without any investigation regarding the ETA closed the chat which did not allow me to chat any further.I then called customer service which was no help at all. I then sent them an email aExplaining that the ETA kept changing and driver was at the same spot for more than 20min and that I only saw that they will charge me after I went through the chat thread but they responded saying that I wanted to cancel and so they did and at the end of the response they said “no response needed”. How horrible and disgusting is this customer service. They did not even bother to investigate why the delivery driver accepted the job but stayed on the same spot for more than 20min. These horrible people did not even consider that that money they took was to buy a meal for my son with learning disability.No investigation was made regarding the driver.Many times I’ve ordered and I can see the driver took the job but the driver would take their own time to deliver. Many times my order is wrong, many times I receive an order where the food is spilled but I don’t really complain but today this company has made a fool out of me and took money from me, money that was meant to buy my son a meal from his favourite restaurant. I am extremely disappointed by this company, their customer service and their  delivery service.We are paying a fee, we are paying the drivers so why are drivers allowed to pick up your order when they feel like doing so. Why were their no investigation into the delivery guy’s ETA or why was he at the same spot for more than 20min. Uber Eats needs to know that their service is not free. We pay for the food and delivery service so why are we treated as if they are doing us a favour and as if the service is free.As said I am so disappointed and disgusted with this company.","Date of experience: December 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,VT,Trust Pilot,,

"As an app it is easy to use and claim back money when things go wrong. However, there should be a way to make more general enquiries and complaints. I ordered from local restaurant that delivered a beef burger instead of chicken burger (as a Hindu that doesn't eat beef this was really upsetting and not acceptable) but was only refunded a low amount and really I would have expected the delivery and fees as well as I paid over £5 for those and ended up hungry. There is no way to make restaurant aware of the mistake and how upsetting and disappointing it was and had to just deal with it.

"6£ for a loaf of bread from the grocery store next door ffs. Misleading advertisement, once you place an order an advertisement pops up “quick you still have 10 minutes to grab anything from grocery store” and once you fall for the trap and add anything from the grocery store you will be charged for it’s delivery fees separately. With every order trillion advertisement appears asking you to join Uber one (or whatever it’s name was) monthly plan to save money on your current order, once you fall for the scam and  join, they don’t refund you any fees as promised. After you join the monthly plan, another add pops up “quick now join the annual plan to save more money on your order” they cram all the ads together so you don’t know what to choose and just pay your money. Expensive delivery prices the cheapest was about 4£ in my area, I pay a quid or two in Deliveroo so no thanks Uber Eats. There’s no way to cancel an order literally immediately after you place it. Very difficult to speak to a human, no phone numbers around, if you have a complaint you’ll be stuck with a bot that will take you to the outer space before guiding you how to file a complaint and wait for couple days to get replies.More importantly, poor poor customer service experience, no sympathy with customers and poor emotional intelligence, they give zero care about the customer, literally like speaking to bots, perhaps their bots interacts better.I tried this app once, and I still regret it.

"First and last time using uber eats. I placed the order online to buy the family some kfc as no-one was up to cooking. The order was placed at 9.10pm with an eatimated delivery of 10-15mins, with an note stating delivery at 10.15pm at the latest. The estimated delivery time changed repeatedly until it was 10.15pm and still showing as processing. Then the delivery time jumped to 10.35pm with the explanation that they couldn't find someone to deliver - so for the full hour they had no-one assigned to our order but just kept us waiting. For an exhausting amount of time we tried using the help section to cancel the order or speak with someone, but got nowhere. Ubereats does have a designated phone line but you will not find a number for it anywhere online (dec23). Eventually, we phoned the Uber taxi service, which Uber makes a point of telling you is geared for travelling customers. Funnily enough, it recognised the mobile number we used for the order and the answering service said it was transferring us to ""uber eats"". I do believe there is a degree of ""spin"" at work here, as we were then told the wait times were extensive and advised to call back later, seconds before putting us through to a rep, where we were able to cancel the order although we have to wait up to 5 working days for it to reach my bank.

"We ordered food for our autistic son on the mcdonald's app. After the delivery time being continuously pushed back with the order status ""picking the order up"" for about 10-15 minutes and the driver on site for this entire duration, our sons food was finally showing out for delivery. This was then followed by the delivery time being pushed further out due to the driver going to a different address. I am under the assumption the driver had multiple deliveries to make, our food arrived. The food was stone cold. I phoned customer service which was of no use at all. I tried to escalate this and although I was put through to a ""manager"", he was a waste of time and breath speaking to. He kept quoting they couldn't do anything as it was delivered within a reasonable time and he was following his guidelines. When I asked what the guidelines were, he went on to quote the delivery time. When I told him again it was delivered after this time and the tracking was apologising for the order being late he still insisted that this was reasonable. We have used uber eats directly and through mcdonald's quite often due to our son and on the previous occasions when we have felt the need to call they have good. After this experience we will no longer be using there service and would advise anyone else against using them.","Date of experience: December 27, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amy Morgan,Trust Pilot,,

I received emails that are supposedly tailored to me with promotional discounts on offer but when I attempt to redeem them within the expiry date, I am told I'm not eligible. Either the marketing and developer teams don't communicate with each other or the promotion is a ploy thinking so little of the consumer that they expect the consumer will capitulate and pay full price.

"Uber Eats has illegally stolen hundreds of dollars from me. On my most recent order to 7-Eleven (7451 S Gartrell Rd) which I paid $43.08 for and selected the option ""meet at door"" and to give a code to receive my order, it was cancelled... before the person ever arrived or was even near my house. It said it was contacted by the uber eats support team, I contacted them, they told me that because the order was started I cannot receive a refund? So because the order was started, and never arrived, after waiting over an hour, i cannot receive a refund when they never gave me what I paid for.This is a common theme for uber eats. Within the last years of order from uber eats they have multiple times, with proof of food not being delivered or receiving the wrong food denied me a refund. The conduct of uber eats and the guidelines they have their employees follow is ILLEGAL. They are told to NOT refund or even respond to customers after they complain.On my previous Better Business Bureau  complaints #20673331, #20437713 & #20454894 each time they claimed they contacted me via email or in-app and each time, did not. Uber Eats tries to deceive the Better Business Bureau and those reading complaints by claiming they reached out and resolved the problem when they never did, they just hope that the person stops responding to the complaint follow ups.If I am not refunded the money from this order and last 2 complaints I did not receive a refund for I am going to be taking legal action. This time, they admitted the food did not come and will not be refunding me, last time the drop off location was wrong, which they admitted, the time before that the submitted picture from the driver showed no food being dropped off, I was denied a refund each time. I NEVER abused the refund system having spent thousands and having minimal refunds given.","Date of experience: December 27, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Mystery Deatin,Trust Pilot,,

"I want to share my recent experience with Uber Eats, and unfortunately, it has been quite disappointing. Firstly, there's a concerning practice where they charge an additional £10 months after ordering, labeling it as a tip without prior notification. This could easily go unnoticed if you don't regularly check your bank statements.Moreover, I encountered a delivery issue where items were missing from my order, and despite contacting them, they refused to refund me without providing any explanation. I have preserved all communication records and screenshots highlighting their stance on not refunding even when the delivery was incomplete.To resolve the issue, I contacted my bank, and they refunded the amount, expressing displeasure at the situation. It's disheartening to see such practices from a service that many rely on.I advise everyone to exercise caution when using the Uber Eats app. Informing my family and friends led to them deleting the app due to similar concerns. It's essential to stay vigilant as it appears the app may be engaging in questionable practices.","Date of experience: November 29, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CU,Trust Pilot,,

"First of all, their customer service is almost non-existent, it took me a lot of time to find a way to flag my issue.The problem was that I ordered food by mistake. The restaurant accepted the order immediately and I cancelled it right after. The whole thing took like 3 seconds, but UberEATS is not refunding me the money. According to them, once the restaurant accepts the order it means they are already preparing it, which in this case was physically impossible. It's like paying in a shop with a wrong bill and the cashier, that didn't even put it in the box yet, stands there with your bill in his/her hand refuses to give it back to you, saying he/she already bought supplies with it. Wouldn't you feel like you've been robbed?Additionally, this app used to have no additional fees. Then they started to charge a service fee, later a delivery fee and lastly the prices of most products are more expensive than they are in the restaurant's menu. You end up paying like extra 5-10€ for your order, and they have the nerve to offer you a ""premium"" membership to remove some of these additional fees, as if they are doing you a favor.

Because my bank account begs to differ!According to their so-called ""customer support,"" the refund should take 5-10 business days to reflect on my account. Well, guess what? It's been over 15 working days, and I'm still empty-handed. They conveniently blamed a mysterious ""pending"" amount on my bank statement, claiming it would disappear within 5-10 business days. Surprise, surprise – it did vanish, but my refund is nowhere to be found.As if that's not enough, UberEats also managed to overcharge me for a repeated order and, to add insult to injury, charged me double for the tip. Are they serious? This is nothing short of a scam! It's clear that UberEats is more interested in taking your money than delivering a reliable service.

I had already paid a £6.20 tip to the Uber delivery guy and £3.99 for delivery - I called Uber eats to complain, the person on the phone I could tell was not taking a proper note of the items missing and he said said it would take 3 weeks to receive a refund for those items (NO REFUND RECEIVED and it’s been 5 weeks now), I asked for a refund on the tip and delivery charged because the food was so cold and not enjoyable - he said he cannot give a refund on that! I think it’s disgusting and a complete con! He kept telling me to contact McDonald’s too but on the McDonald’s app it says to contact Uber Eats! The guy on the phone at Uber Eats was just fobbing me off, I could tell straight away he wasn’t going to help just by the tone of his voice and carelessness he had. I could tell he wasn’t making a note of what I was saying. This business needs to be investigated because it’s fraud taking someone’s money and not providing a refund when due! I certainly won’t risk using them again.","Date of experience: November 21, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CO,Trust Pilot,,

"UBER EATS DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. I would give MINUS STARS if I could !!!!!  Yesterday I ordered a Mc Delivery from my local branch . Not for the first time items were missing. Obviously I rang Uber eats support line and told them the items that were missing. After being on hold I was told that for some reason ( I can only assume that because I have called on several occasions before about missing items ) that my refund was refused. I asked to speak to a manager and got the same response.  Uber eats was NOT prepared to reimburse me for a fault that was NOT my own !!! So the money for the missing items is basically THEFT .   given how poor the service is that I've received I would imagine that the attitude travels all the way up to the top. Trying to get some sort of resolution from UBER EATS is so difficult. Web sites make it as difficult as possible to complain. Trying to talk to anyone who gives a crap is impossible. AVOID UBER EATS at all COSTS . I have to say that MCDONALD'S CUSTOMER SERVICE eventually gave me some vouchers as a way of an apology, even though they are not responsible for refunds when food is delivered by uber eats, so credit to them.","Date of experience: December 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,WE,Trust Pilot,,

"Glitchy app not updated properly - refused refund for propblem with app. Difficult to get help with order issues, app purposefully designed to take you around in circles - hard to find or even ring customers services - I had to actually find a way to sneakily get through to their Uber Rider support to get a transfer to Customer Services (you can only ring when you have a live order).Full explanation of issue belowI made an order on my route home - the app was trying to deliver to my live location. I updated the app to drop off to my home address and placed the order. Unfortunately the app was still trying to deliver to the street I was on - the app does not let you update the order and theres no apparent way of updating order any other way. I had no choice but to cancel my food. I reordered and the app recognised second time that I'd updated to my home address. I want a refund for the first cancelled order - it was not my fault the app was not updating properly, and I also reordered immediately after so the food would not have been wasted as I reordered it - the specific takeaway also took ages with my order so was running behind so no food would have even been prepped on the first cancelled order.

It used to be great, fast delivery, good customer service and since about March 2023 it turned bad.  I had some issues with some orders where I had to beg to have compensation on missing items.  I have NEVER made a false report! On December 1st I decided to treat myself and order for 44.68$ of Starbucks, at this point I am an UberOne member as well, and please note in my area Starbucks is NOT in the UberOne location so I had to pay full fee and delivery.  I received everything EXCEPT one item worth 3.95$.  I looked into the help section and the option ""missing item"" was not there.  So I contacted help who refused to refund the missing item.  I was not asking much.  I was asking 3.95$/44.68$ they refused.  I took the conversion in screenshot, called PayPal, sent it to them and they agreed that this was not okay and refunded the 3.95$.  On December 14 due to having automatic payments UberEats charged me that 3.95$ again.  I contacted them, they said they would transfer me to a specialist and it would take 6 to 12h. On the 18th I wrote back saying with the lack of answer I am filing with PayPal again.  Today I cancelled my UberOne membership considering after this event they removed all my promotion.

"Having created a delivery order with one supermarket on the UBER app, I had not noticed that there was still ONE small item (milk) left in the cart from a second supermarket. Proceeding to check out, I authorised payment for the main delivery, however the UBER app somehow placed a second order for the small item not required.  No where during the process did the app inform me of this, nor did I authorise the additional order / payment.  The main delivery arrived, followed shortly by the incorrect order.  For context, the incorrect order item value was £1.50 - however after fee's and delivery charge it came to £11!!! Which, even if it had been a valid order, would amount to theft!! I quickly contacted UBER via the chat function, and explained the situation.  Suffice it say, UBER was not in the slightest interested in resolving the issue, and repeatedly explained that the order had been generated from a device associated to my account.  They basically dismissed my concern out of hand, and were not willing to accept that the issue was caused by the app.  I am completely disgusted with the attitude of UBER in this case, and warn all users to be vigilant when committing their hard earned money to this company.  UBER could have easily resolved this complaint by issuing a credit note or refund, but simply were disinterested. Please be aware and careful.  UBER, you should be ashamed.","Date of experience: December 19, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GW,Trust Pilot,,

I ordered from a Mexican place through Uber Eats. But when I received the order it was only half the items. I called the restaurant immediately and they verified that the full order was sent out. So i tried calling the driver but received no response.Then i gave my feedback on uber eats who refunded my money. But this whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth.Once i started looking online about Uber reviews i felt i made a huge mistake by ordering from this company. Looks like issues like this are common place. Just hoping i have done by job by warning others.

"I am extremely disappointed with my Uber Eats experience with KFC. The delivery was a disaster from start to finish. Despite placing my order promptly, it took over an hour for the driver to even pick it up. By the time the delivery arrived, a whopping 90 minutes later, everything was cold – a clear indication that the food had been neglected. To add insult to injury, the items weren't even properly sorted, resulting in a mixed-up mess.What's more infuriating is the lack of support from Uber Eats. Despite reporting the issue, they only refunded me for the mixed-up items, completely ignoring the fact that the entire order was cold and inedible. This is unacceptable, and it reflects poorly on both KFC and Uber Eats. I won't be using this service again, and I strongly advise others to think twice before trusting them with their meal deliveries.","Date of experience: December 19, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Евгеша Воривода,Trust Pilot,,

"Uber Eats charged me FULL price for an order I cancelled less than ONE MINUTE of ordering.  Why did I cancel you ask? Because delivery was going to be over an hour even though I'm paying for 20-30 minute delivery.  This is so illogical and illegal!! They charged me $60 because apparently in less than one minute, the restaurant had my order going already.  To top it all off while speaking to god knows who on their chat, I asked to speak with a supervisor or manager because that person wasn't answering my questions and their response was, we all follow the same guidelines.  When I checked my cc statement I saw that I had been charged multiple times, so when I inquired about that, the chat person responded with, we'll have someone call you within 6-12 hours and left the chat...","Date of experience: December 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nadia Monroe,Trust Pilot,,

"Most disgusting company I've ever had to deal with. I am part of Uber one, on two occasions now you've credited my account due to mistakes made by yourself (as your promise to your Uber one customers). The first £5 was credited because items were out of stock and my order was cancelled and the second time was due to the order taking too long so I had £10 in my Uber cash pot. I placed an order and used £5 of this cash towards the order but upon looking at the invoice the £5 wasn't actually credited to the order it was just stolen from my cash pot. I messaged you about it and you relied you have 'decided not to give me the £5 anymore'!!!!!! I've then been to check my account today and it appears the other £5 has now been taken as well. You make promises to your customers when part or Uber one but then decide afterwards you don't want to give them the credit promised? If you didn't want to give it dont make the promise and don't give it. But the fact you've put it into my account and then stolen it back is absolutely disgusting. This will be going to consumer rights and I'll be contacting citizens advice of where I stand with this as in my eyes it's theft of my money you had already given me then decided to take back for no apparent reason or explanation from yourselves.

I placed a order through the McDonald’s app, Uber eats was the transportation provider to deliver this, as soon as the order is accepted the mcdonalds make the order, Uber eats accepted and cancelled delivery of my order twice and the food was waiting in the restaurant for 40 minutes before another drive picked this up to deliver this, on arrival the food was stone cold and 2 items of food were missing from the bag! It took Uber eats 1 hour and 10 minutes to deliver the food, when I contacted them they refused to refund the order, even when escalating this to a manger they still refused to refund stating that because they delivered it within the time frame of the 3rd driver accepting this 40 minutes later after 2 previous drivers accepted them cancelled they are not responsible for issues with the order being stone cold or items missing.

"If I could give them a 0 star I would, absolutely shocking customer service from the driver that was tasked to deliver my McDonalds food last night; it's not the first time I have had issues with this company delivery service, but last night takes the mickey. I clearly listed my address and postcode (a residential address, might I add) correctly on my order, (no one else except uber has difficulties with my address), yet the driver's app that he uses sent him to the wrong location. When he called to ask why I was not at the destination to accept my order, I informed him that there was no-one at my house and I asked him where he was. He rudely stated that he was at the steel works entrance (3 and a half miles away from where I live in the middle of an industrial estate). When I explained he was in the wrong area and tried to give him directions he flat out and rudely stated he would not be delivering my order as it is too far out of his way. I had to argue that I had clearly stated my correct address when placing the order and that he should complete the delivery to the correct address as required but he just told me he would not deliver as he would not get paid the extra mileage - how is this my issue? He went to the wrong address, he is at fault, yet he was trying to blame me - He simply told me that he would not deliver and that the order will be cancelled and I should take it up with McDonalds then hung up the phone. So i was left out of pocket (as Uber will take up to 15days to refund me - your customer service line is just as useless when I tried calling them alongside McDonalds by the way), with 2 very hungry children. I will be avoiding the company at all cost in the future -as will everyone I have spoken to who have had similar issues - clearly this company does not care about its customers.","Date of experience: December 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Kayleigh John,Trust Pilot,,

The promo was for your first order only,"" which translates to, ""Oops, you're to stupid to know you have to activate the clandestine offer first, you idiot.""

But, gotta be real, a couple of times my order played hide and seek with some missing items or took the scenic route to my place. The app can be a bit wonky too, throwing in a few tech tantrums.

They charged me £10 over what their original receipt said. I screenshot this receipt. Then once I confirmed the cost and the food was on its way the payment updated to £10 over what I agreed to pay and they tried to claim this didn’t happen- they are saying that delivery costs went up. I agreed to pay 2.49 for delivery and not £10 for a delivery round the corner. Please keep an eye out for your digital receipts and what is actually requested out of your account as this seems to be a common complaint with Uber eats. I have screenshots of both receipts. The customer service then tried to lie to me and say this didn’t happen and refused to let me provide the screenshots.

"Well fortunately I actually got the 100 dollar Uber eats card via Caesers Rewards Sportsbook and Casino for the tier level I achieved and that's what will make this review civil as it will be, had I subsequently purchased the card with my hard earned money I would be absolutely beside myself and I would be attacking the company with every single breath in my body for a number of ridiculous reasons but I didn't pay for it with my cash therefore I would be wasting additional time in my life to do anymore than I am , but I feel like I might be able to help someone else who very well might be oblivious to the deceptive value of the Uber Eats Corp  and there criminal like unchanging of already extremely high prices of fast food , and general on the go meals they offer , but I will focus on one single incident and that was the meal I elected at a popular sub restaurant Firehouse Sub l, as I contemplated my first meal purchase it was clearly obvious that the option of purchase and delivery of the meal was a out of the question, so I was forced to utilize the pickup option only to get the shock of my life within the arena of fast food ordering since I was new to this form of ordering I chose to wait and place my order within the establishment because my attempts were stiffled with each way I tried to make the order complete and it seemed as if I was doing something incorrectly because the price was so much more than that of the establishment had I ordered it as I always had with cash so once at Firehouse it became clear that the ordering process would be much more different than I could've ever imagined, but I had paid nothing for the Uber card and yet I found it difficult to continue with the order once I realized that the pizza meatball sub that I love so much had a surcharge amount additional to its original price and for what I have found to be nothing more than a sheer luxury of having a plastic card with the Uber logo upon it because just days earlier I had this exact same meal of sandwich and soda was roughly $17.42 was now costing me $22.47 it was clear that the privilege of having the opportunity to purchase the meal with the stylish and sleek design of the Uber Eats card was just a mere 5 dollars and 5 cent which ultimately was nothing at all seeing that the card in hand made me feel as if I was the late Anthony Bourdain deep within the 🇮🇹 Italy on a dangerous excursion in search of the perfect slices of pepperoni,  even though I was merely deep within the hills and my very own nightmare of the great state of West Virgina on a cols tuesday night , Uber Eats should be ashamed of themselves but i grant you there anything but!!!!!

"I can't believe you guys do this here in Portugal! I can't! You offer something for a price (and this should be honoured!), then the next screen says about half portion and full portion, being the full portion more expensive than the offer.

The worst is: you don't even mention, on the second screen, how many pastéis are a half partion and how many are the full one! This is totally confusing and misleading.It doesn't exist! It's illegal! How does the government allows that?!What about the fries? You don't even mention how much (quantity, grams) they are. How can you just sell something without clear information? How can I know if I received the correct quantity?! So you just put as little fries as you want??Not to mention the drink, I asked for a Fanta and received a coke.

"After waiting over an hour for food from a restaurant that is a) fast food and 2)less than 10 minute drive from my home, I contacted uber and they refunded my order. The issue I have is the a hole driver who was waiti by at the restaurant where my food was ready for ages, hoping he would get more pick ups from same place. When I contacted him via text, he ignored my question as to when I can expect collection and why a 10-15minute delay was being added to my delivery time that went from 17:50 to 18:35. When i later text back to say ‘you keep delaying my order’ his response was ‘yes’. This thieving sc um knew exactly what he was doing because when I then contacted uber (finally able to get to a human via chat after 10 mins of frustratingly trying) the agent cancelled my order without a fee and at that EXACT moment, my order got collected from the Barnsley peel st KFC. I have no idea if the drivers can track or get notified when you speak to an agent, but its a great coincidence that the moment my order got cancelled he suddenly collects it. I hope he chokes on it and the haram food he steals from customers comes back to find him. I will never use uber eats again ever and have told my family to do same, this incident was on my mums uber account as we were at hers and the kids wanted a treat. Waited and wasted over an hour for a mr selvin or selvan something from barnsley uber eats to steal our order and take the absolute mick.

"Uber is the most anti customer company on earth. If you ever have an issue, you'll end up talking to 10 clueless foreigners that refuse to help and disconnect on you.

"I placed an ordered through UBER Eats for my mother today from Arby's Glendale location mind you it was $68 plus a $12 tip. I have never had an issued with Uber Eats until today, the driver named Wynona stated that she was enroute with our order, I go outside to look and of course the order was not where in sight,  plus when I made an attempt to call her, and of course she did not pick up the damn phone. So I contacted Uber Eats Customer Service and the female was very attentive plus she reimburse us with Uber Cash. This is the kicker, this Wynona had the audacity to say that she dropped the food off at an apartment building, first of all, I do not stay in an apartment building and I told that representative that her ass need to be fired, when you decided that you wanted to steal from my mother, now I want to give her a beat down.

HOWEVER, in the last 2-3 weeks I’ve had some serious issues and no direct support… I ordered something the charge was pending on my bank account but the store-the food- the order disappeared from the Uber eats app. Then I ordered something else a week later and the driver brought me someone else’s order! My order was £25 and the order received was worth £10 when I told the driver it wasn’t my order he refused to take the order back and told me to take it up with Uber. I reached out to Uber and they stilllll charged me for the meal I never got!! Not to mention I have dietary restrictions and nothing in the order I could’ve eaten. Now in Uber eats it says my order was £7 but I have screenshots of everything.

"The Customer Service Team is absolutely shocking, what has happened in the world for the customer experience not to be at the forefront of a company's agenda. As soon as I ordered my meal this morning little did I know the aggro I would get over the next couple of hours, I would rather have gone hungry if I'd have known. Only half of my food arrived, I presumed after calling the team I would either get it sent to me again (wishful thinking) or get a refund. I got a quarter of my refund owed to me. After ringing back due to their mistake, and after speaking to the manager she could not do anything else for me. They had a guideline to follow and that was that and as they had refunded a small amount back they couldnt do anymore. I asked how was a guideline being followed when the majority of my items had not been delivered and also not refunded. The manager should not have this title!So not only did I lose out on food this morning I also lost money. I would never use this company for anything ever again; that is how shocked I feel with regards to their aftercare. They need to re-think their stratagy in what they are hoping to achieve and complete re-training.

The same thing has happened with Uber, I placed an order last night for mcdonalds around 7.20, by 8.45 the order had not even been collected by the courier, i had 4 different drivers assigned and they all cancelled, eventually after a very long wait i got to speak to someone on live chat who cancelled my order and as a 'gesture of goodwill' cancelled the charge (they tried to charge me the full food order to cancel?!) it really is unacceptable, i'm diabetic and i was really needing to eat at this point, almost 9pm and still no food. I had to make a microwave meal in desperation/quickness. They gave me a £5 voucher because my order guarantee time was missed which i've (stupidly) used again this morning on breakfast, thinking, surely, breakfast at 11am is not going to be terribly busy from an independent little shop in town centre, apparently so, i'm still waiting and a driver has not been assigned again (after 3 already cancelling so far) i honestly will never use UE again. estimated delivery time from my order is now 12.45, ridiculous. it's not even the drivers necessarily who are at fault here, something is very very wrong.","Date of experience: December 08, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JE,Trust Pilot,,

I called right away and was instructed to send a screen shot of the promo code from my email to be refunded. I followed up after not hearing back within 48 hours. 4 days later I still had zero response so I called back. I was told there was an issue in their system and the code has been de-activated which is hilarious because the promotion is still being advertised in my app while I type this ...on the phone call I was told that I could not be transfered to a manager or supervisor as non were available since they were all busy helping other users. I offered to wait and said I did not want to get off the phone until I had a refund resolution as I really need the funds back. I was told that the case had to be escalated to a special team and that id hear back in 1-2 days. I've wasted over 3 hours of my time trying to get money back that I am owed. I would have never placed the order if I didn't receive the promo code. UBER EATS SCAMMING PEOPLE. For this 3rd phone call, after being on the phone trying to advocate for myself for over 40 mins I was hung up on by the rep.

"Had a fraudulent $1.2k order placed on my account from Texas (we live in Canada and have NO relations to Texas), and none of the: 'premium' support, Uber support Twitter account or reaching out directly within the app/site helped. I spent OVER a week reiterating the issue with representatives of their team (new ones every time since they never stay connected to support chats/emails/DMs), and was told every single time that I would either: a) get a report filed to get assistance from their technical support team, b) that someone I knew must have been using my account and that it was a miscommunication, or c) that they looked into the order and came to the conclusion that the purchase was 100% valid. The absolute BEST their customer service did was: offer $15 in credit....I mean, honestly. My family has TWO separate uber one accounts and we will be cancelling all and deleting our accounts. If you're ever concerned about security, and how customer services may help you with it -- they won't. I had better luck with the police and my bank.Let me just say, as a final note, I work as a cloud security engineer at a large company and am in AWE at the blatant disregard for security and issues related to fraud/cybersecurity that Uber seems to have as a whole. I should have known since 2018 (when they finally announced their customer account data was hacked in 2017 -- yes, a whole YEAR later) that they would not change their ways.Please reconsider using any Uber apps.","Date of experience: November 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,EK,Trust Pilot,,

When I asked them to justify these reasons I was told they would investigate it and get back to me but for now half of it had been processed and would be back in my account in the next few days. 1 month later, I never heard back from them and I also never received my refund. I have since tried chasing my refund to be told because I didn't notify them within 48 hours I am not eligible for a refund though I have receipt proof they told me they were refunding half of it as they already did the admin and adjusted it on my order when I originally contacted them on the day I received my order! I have since heard from them by my constant chasing that they will not be adjusting my refund to the full amount though won't explain their reasons and are also now refusing to refund me what they once stated they would.

I had paid the extortionate price for priority delivery (power cut, food off at home). I then watched the driver make multiple stops around my area and then 35 mins later reach my house. My food as you can imagine was stone cold, no saving it and went straight in the bin. I complained and Ubereats refunded me out of a £16.39 bill only £3.28. I am absolutely disgusted and fuming.So in return i spoke to one of the drivers to find out what is going on, why is uber eats failing customers and then not refunding them.The driver told me that Ubereats does not pay a wage people can live on and the place to be is actually Deliveroo, who provide a proper wage. Obviously you are going to deliver the food you get the best pay on first. Since deleting my Uber eats app and changing service, i have had zero issues. I was shocked at the turn around of service. The biggest surprise was also the cost, so much cheaper. Not multiple service charges like uber eats calculating £4-6, before the delivery fee is then added. I still want the rest of my refund!

"This is the worst customer support and service experience ive had in recent memory. We wasted 2 hours waiting for food (that was never going to come!) and about 20-40 minutes trying to reach an honestly inexcusably bad customer service. All while in between we were being assured that our order is coming and the uber driver changed so we had to wait just a bit longer! Turns out the store was not even open!!! We ordered food from a store that was closed for the day and they kept telling us the order is waiting to be picked up!!! Forgetting about that, imagine that someone does not have enough money to place a new order. The representative did not even give me time to react as he/she proceeded to refund in 3-5 days. Never even asking if that would be okay or giving any other option such as ""add it to my wallet"" so that someone without more money can order straight away. But i guess they don't care if you cant afford another order and cant feed your guests!"". Later I'm met with this cold apathy where the customer service representative doesn't even allow me to get a word in edgewise and proceeds to quickly try and make an excuse in the end that obviously was a lie (since the store told methey were not even open at the time). I had a friend over from abroad that day and we wasted our evening waiting on food to start a movie and hearing excuses and frankly a refusal to communicate by both the store (who again, turned out to be closed) and Uber.

"Horrendous service. We'd not had a knock at the door and it was 20 mins late so I went to ring up to ask what was happening and saw a text saying it had been delivered. When I went in to the app it showed a pic of a McD's bag next to our shed in the garden. I went and retrieved it from the far end of our back garden. So the lad had walked through our gate into the back garden and rather than walk the further 15 paces or so to the house door they just left it there next to some rubble and breezeblocks. I rang to get a refund and the lad said he couldn't give a refund because it had been delivered on time! Even though he'd not gone anywhere near our house (the place he actually was meant to deliver it to!) and the delivery hadn't been done he said he was unable to refund because if its on time then that makes it fine! He didn't seem to want to allow me to take it further as after 3 times of asking he'd still not told me what the complaints process was and/or how we could discuss this with a manager (at McD's or Uber Eats). I've had loads of deliverys with them before but neither our family or any of our close friends/family will be ordering from them again. The worst thing is I tipped them before the delivery on the app, what a mug!

He then proceeds to say he'll call me back and blocks my number. I call uber eats to report the issue i'm spoken to like some kind of idiot but suprisingly agreed to refund even though i still want my order. 15 god damn days to recieve my money back and thats even if it happens it was just verbal confirmation over the phone.

Terrible customer service/chat had 3 groceries delivery that failed in single day. The tracking in app was useless. Timer keeper going up for over 3 hours. Finally opened up chat/support and they said the order was still on its way will be about 15 minutes. 30 minutes later opened up chat again and then they said there is a issue on store end they have accepted the order.They finally cancelled the orders and transferred me to another agent to see why this has happened then omg they keeper asking for an order number. Looking inside the app and emails no order numbers for the 3 orders I stated that to them numerous times and got the same copy paste answer asking for it . I have had more luck in getting my 5 year old to listen then getting anywhere with Uber support. I then stated I was closing my account and removing the Uber one. They then miraculously found my orders without an order number and offered me a 3 pound voucher for my troubles. By this time al the local grocery places was closed so I told them to close my account as this was unacceptable. They then told me to check on google on how to close my account.

"I tried to do something nice for a friend. She was going through a rough time in her life so I wanted to surprise her with groceries. She lives with her grandmother. Her grandmother, didn’t know the order was coming. I received a notification on my phone The Uber driver clicked “delivered” on the ap. I thought the food was delivered. I called the grandma later to check up on the order to ensure she received it and that raccoons didn’t and she said she didn’t accept it. Once the Uber driver came to the door the grandma declined the order because she didn’t know they were meant for her and she didn’t want to take someone else’s food. I called Walmart, they said the food was not returned. The Uber chat was useless to say the least. I contacted them, the customer service rep said there’s no refund and nothing that can be done. I said let me talk to a manager. She said sure I can do that but they’re going to give you the same information I am. I said, so it’s a dead end solution you’re giving me? And she responded yes. She said the Uber driver can take the food if declined and told me to read under the terms and use of Uber eats. I said this can’t possibly be what’s written under Uber eats terms? Management later called me and said the same thing. Useless and not helpful. They said the driver tried to contact me. I said there are no missed callsOn my end. They said they had record of the contact being made. I asked for those records. They said that option is not available. I asked to speak to a higher up. They said that option is not available. $98 down the drain. Uber Eats is the leading brand in deliveries. They know this. They knowinglytake advantage and abuse there power. This is middle class people who they’re knowingly taking advantage off. They have a major surplus of customers. They don’t care about keeping customers. That was made apparent to me. They made me feel dumb. They were NOT helpful. No refund was provided. The groceries never made it to my friend. They said everything was done on there end correctly and made me feel stupid for trying to do something kind.

I will never use Uber eats again. The company are scammers.They use the pending method to scam customers. It is an I.T glitch which they are taking advantage of to fraud customers and gaining double payments for the one transaction. My account was debited on day of transaction which went into pending on my mobile banking app! That reflected on my balance on that day for the goods. Then 5 days later my balance decreases again for the exact same amount. I contacted my bank and they advised me that only one payment has gone out to Uber eats however my remaining balance monies does not reflect that. Please be aware this is a loophole in the system an It glitch which they have cottoned onto Uber eats are fraudulently taking extra money from their customers without their knowledge and without their consent. I will never use the company again and I strongly recommend that no one else should unless they want to fall prey like me and be double charged for the same items.

"The service is terrible! I have had a number of small issues, but the one that tipped me over the edge was yesterday. Me and my wife had our first child and needed to order some essentials. I placed the order and was informed it would be here within 30 mins. Roughly an hour later, nothing. Called the shop where my order was being collected, they stated the delivery person attempted to call and deliver but bought the shopping back. So I call Uber eats customer service line to be informed that the driver tried contacting me and waited 7 minutes for me. This is not true at all!! I have no missed calls on my mobile device or voice messages. No one pulled up outside our house or knocked! So I had to leave my wife who was still recovering from the birth with our little one and get the essentials. Awful service, awful customer service.

"Uber Eats ￼ Can we talk about how poor Uber eats customer service really is on Friday Dec 1. I ordered from Wingstop and immediately contacted them to cancel my order because I got a call from my sister saying that my mom has had a heart attack so I went to cancel it so I can go to her. The first thing I tried to do was just to cancel it in general, but I had to use the chat bot thing in order to do that, so it asked me what are the reasons why that I am canceling my order and I said that I ordered it by mistake because we didn’t really have an option for saying that you had a family emergency so I just put it as a mistake, but it wouldn’t take it and the app kept bugging like it was delaying everything so I just ended up asking for a representative to speak to, an actual person they contacted me with was Nanci. Mind you before Nanci even got on the chat. It took an incredibly long time, maybe five minutes before I even got in contact with her and then as I was talking to her explaining as to why I went to cancel my order her replies took at least 2 to 4 minutes now I worked customer service for a very long time and I know how to cancel orders it doesn’t take 2 to 3 minutes or 2 to 4 minutes to get on the chat and be like hey I can totally do that for you. It doesn’t take that long so then after I dealt with her and got fed up with Her, she referred me to some team that could further help me but that team response would’ve took 6 to 12 hours. Why would it take 6 to 12 hours for them to cancel our order? By the time that it would take 6 to 12 hours my order would already be there and I wouldn’t be home, so I called customer service they weren’t any better. I called them and they had me on hold for 11 to probably 18 minutes and then I got in contact with Nel or Mel I can’t remember which one but it was one of those two and she put me on hold probably like two or three times and was saying how they can’t give they can’t cancel my order because the food was already in route. But if they would’ve canceled it from the gecko, the food would not have been in route, so they purposely delayed and stalled in order for my food to go out so they wouldn’t have to cancel so they could still get money. So then I asked her if I could speak to her supervisor and she replied how they would say the exact same thing to me as she did and how they wouldn’t be able to get in contact in contact with me for at least 24 hours so then I asked her for her employee ID number, she said they’re not allowed to give those out. I think asked for her last name and she wouldn’t give me it either. Then I heard back from another lady I can’t remember her name but I do have screenshots of everything so I will be inserting that into the post but she  contacted me and said that she saw that my food has already been delivered and there’s nothing else they can do.they purposely stall you so they don’t have to cancel it so we don’t have to get money back and they want your money. They don’t care if your food is on the way or not I highly highly highly suggest not ordering from them no more unless you want to get scammed constantly.Again please don’t order from them! They’re horrible and only want your money! They don’t care about customers service at all! Please spread the word!","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KA,Trust Pilot,,

"As the title says, do NOT save your credit card or other payment option in this app.I'm from Spain, somebody got into my account and ordered a 1499$ worth MacBook in San Antonio TX, US in a CostCo.Uber eats didn't ask for any confirmation SMS code or anything. I just realised that this happened because I got an alert from my bank that this movement was charged on my card.I managed to install the app and cancel it on time, so I was lucky.In any case, I think that if all my orders are below 50€ in Spain and you receive an order of 1499$ in the US, this should have raised some alert in Uber eats and should have blocked it out at least asked for some SMS code or similar.Since I managed to cancel it I tried to contact the support team and they didn't reply for one week, and now that they answered, they didn't even read the comments, just replied that they don't see that amount charged... When I already explained that was cancelled on time.From a serious company I would have expect some promise to improve the security, maybe some apologies and even try to find who made this order, as that lesson had to enter a physical address for the delivery.To sum up, beware of keeping any payment method on this app","Date of experience: November 26, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Pedro Sanchez,Trust Pilot,,

"The level of sheer incompetence of this company is overwhelming. I ordered mcdonalds through uber eats and mcdonalds failed to comply with additions to burgers which were paid for and also just failed to even add a burger into my order. The food arrived cold. I advised Ubereats that despite the food being cold my issue was one the special request and the missing burger and request a refund of these. They responded and advised no refund was forthcoming because apparently I had had adjustments in my orders before. I advised them I tend to order from mcdonalds and their level of incompetence is matched by ubereats, ergo, there were issues with previous orders. Please let me point out happy to pay for what i receive even if it is cold. Not happy to pay for items not received cause I didn’t receive them. Sounds like fraud. Complained many a time, requested information on their complaints procedure and also their regulatory body and was shut down. In a nutshell, uber eats represents the companies with whom they are partnered to. If mcdonalds does not fulfil my order correctly then I request a refund from ubereats. Ubereats seems to think that they can get away charging for items not received. Shocking. Actually morally disgusting really.

"I used to order food often from Uber Eats. It was by far my most used app for food in general. Today they lost themselves a customer.Not only the platform is extremely unreliable and inaccurate on its estimates (ETAs) — which means your 20 min order easily becomes 1h — but trying to solve an issue with your order is nearly impossible.Customer support is nonexistent. Whatever they call a “help centre” takes ages to respond, which means there’s no addressing an ongoing or recent order. If you’re lucky enough to get a response, they’ll simply automatically apply whatever solution sounds best for their business rather than for the customer, therefore simply ignoring the problem itself and dismissing your concerns. My order was ridiculously wrong, which I realised as soon as I entered my apartment. I tried reaching out and it took them almost a full day to get back to me. So there was no returning the order, no getting a new order or ordering something else. No option. The only thing I had was a “wait for our response”, which in turn came through an automated solution that I did not agree to. But here’s the catch: even if you don’t agree to the solution, they’ll just go ahead and do it anyway because they don’t care what you think. After that, good luck trying to get anything else done. The case is closed. And so is my account now.","Date of experience: November 30, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,GA,Trust Pilot,,

"I am compelled to share my horrendous experience with Uber Eats, and the lack of customer support has left me utterly frustrated.I recently placed an order through Uber Eats, and to my dismay, the food never arrived. The order mysteriously vanished from my 'past orders' on the app, leaving me in a state of confusion. Desperate for assistance, I embarked on a futile journey to seek support.I tried reaching out through three different phone numbers, three email addresses, and even attempted to navigate the unhelpful website and app. Unfortunately, none of these avenues provided the assistance I needed. The app couldn't locate my order, and every time I managed to connect with a human, I was transferred to a different department, only to have the line abruptly disconnect.Feeling exasperated and out of options, I resorted to creating a Twitter account just to seek support. It is disheartening that I had to resort to such measures to address a simple issue with my order.The most frustrating part of this ordeal is the apparent intentional difficulty Uber imposes on customers seeking a refund. The lack of a streamlined support system and the constant runaround from one department to another is unacceptable.Uber Eats needs to seriously reevaluate its customer support infrastructure to ensure that customers can easily and efficiently resolve issues. No one should have to jump through such hoops just to address a missing order and seek a refund.I sincerely hope Uber Eats takes notice of this review and implements improvements in their customer support system. As it stands, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I caution others to be wary of relying on Uber Eats for their food deliveries.","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,William Bones,Trust Pilot,,

"I am writing this complaint review to express my extreme frustration with the difficulty I encountered while trying to reach Uber's customer service. As a loyal customer, I expected a smooth and efficient process, but unfortunately, my recent experience left me feeling incredibly dissatisfied.Firstly, it took an unreasonable amount of time and effort to even get through to a representative. The long wait times and constant automated messages only added to my frustration. When I finally connected with a customer service agent, the language barrier became immediately apparent. The representative I spoke to did not have a strong command of English, which made it incredibly challenging to communicate my issue effectively.The most frustrating part of the conversation was when I had to provide my email address. Despite spelling it out phonetically multiple times, the representative seemed unable to comprehend or accurately record the information. I had to repeat my email address over seven times, which was not only time-consuming but also incredibly inefficient.Furthermore, I am deeply disappointed with Uber's refusal to refund my order. The food I received was stone cold, likely due to being delivered on a bicycle in freezing temperatures. This not only compromised the quality of the meal but also posed a potential health risk.As a customer, I expect to be treated with respect and to receive assistance from knowledgeable representatives who can understand and address my concerns effectively. Unfortunately, this experience with Uber's customer service fell far short of my expectations.I hope that Uber takes this feedback seriously and takes steps to improve their customer service and refund policy. It is essential for a company of their stature to provide efficient and effective support to their customers, especially when issues like food quality and delivery conditions arise.","Date of experience: December 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MJ,Trust Pilot,,

"If the order is processed as expected and you get your food, great. If things go wrong be prepared to say goodbye to your payment and/or your food. The customer service is non-existent with Uber eats. They make it very difficult to resolve any issues - the agent will stick to a script regardless. The restaurant called me to say they didn't have the item I had ordered. They offered me the choice to order something else or request a refund via Uber eats. I opted for a refund. Mistake. Uber eats refused to engage with me. So be prepared to lose your money if the restaurant doesn't have what you order. The app is deliberately set up to minimise any customer service contact that you can have with them. Each time I sent a message and got a minimal response, I was requested to rate the response but it disappeared when I clicked on it. Possibility that the agent did this to avoid low scores.

I used Uber eats for a delivery when I was out of town in a hotel. My order was wrong and I had no utensils to eat with. I called the restaurant straight away as they are the ones who messed up my order. They told me to call back the next day to speak with a manager about my refund as it was about to close. When I finally got a hold of him he stated I had to get a refund from Uber eats as that’s who I paid and they would go to the restaurant. I then started contacting them and they didn’t want to refund my order. They only refunded me part of what was missing and then told me I was past the refund time. I explained I was in contact with the restaurant at first as I thought they were who messed up my order but then I did contact Uber eats. And if I was past the refund time why did they refund $12 of the $50 order then. That was an insult. I won’t use Uber eats again.

"I am compelled to leave this one-star review after a truly frustrating experience with Uber Eats. After placing an order, our delivery person spent 30 minutes unsuccessfully searching for our building. Despite my attempts to assist through phone calls and in-app messaging, she left without delivering our meal. To add insult to injury, when I cancelled the order due to this confusion, Uber Eats retained my payment instead of issuing a refund. My efforts to explain the situation fell on deaf ears as their customer service showed a complete lack of empathy and understanding.

The amount I spent at McDonald's was £25.08 and what I received in the Co-Op bag was £10.40, so not even monetary similarity. The pictorial evidence I was supplied with was the courier holding up a co-op bag in front of my house (not in any way similar to a McDonalds) but this clearly isn't enough to warrant a refund from Uber. I spent over an hour trying to negotiate the customer services lines with calls that would just go round in circles regarding my complaints history all of which have been made within reason, i.e. past incorrect orders.So in effect, I'm being penalised for the ineptness of the local couriers.","Date of experience: November 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MD,Trust Pilot,,

I contacted Uber eats support, who on chat asked for screenshots, and when provided, said price will be adjusted and I should wait. The charge finalized and price was not adjusted. I contacted them again, they told me they cannot do anything because I contacted them after 48 hours! I explained multiple times that I had contacted immediately and was told to wait and now I am being told that I should have contacted immediately.

"I recently placed an order with Amigos Feltham through Uber Eats, and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. The delivery was not only extremely late but also arrived cold, prompting me to have to use the microwave to heat up my food. To add to the frustration, the milkshake included in the order had spilled inside the bag.Upon contacting Uber and providing photographic evidence of the issues, the response I received was less than satisfactory: ""We will be unable to provide a refund on this occasion. We understand that these issues do arise on occasion, but not often at this regularity.""I'm puzzled by the term ""regularity"" used here, and frankly, I don't comprehend Uber's decision. In a highly competitive food delivery industry where numerous alternatives exist, it's essential for platforms to prioritize customer satisfaction. If this is the level of service and understanding offered by Uber, it's crucial for them to recognize that customers wield significant influence. Our choices as consumers shape the success of platforms, and when service falls short, we have the power to choose alternatives that prioritize our experience. The competitive landscape is vast, and as customers, we should expect and demand better.For the record Amigos is amazing and will not lose my custom.

"I don't know why I keep using Uber Eats  because every time there is an issue with the delivery (rarely the food). Drivers cancel pick up, or there appears to be multiple pick ups/drops offs. The app always starts with ""it'll be with you in 10 mins"" but the estimated delivery time creeps up and up, before you know it, 45 mins later you may actually get your food. If it's going to be 45 minutes, just tell me that to begin with!

"After spending thousands of dollars (we are a homebound family) these past few years with Uber Eats, we will no longer be using their service. Our last 5+ orders (from various restaurants) were missing at least one item. This was incredibly frustrating as we had to scramble to cook something up so that the family member who didn’t get their meal could eat. In addition to dealing this frustration, the company decided to enforce a policy that they would not refund us for the missing food (likely an assumption that we were being dishonest). Rather than solving a delivery problem, they have chosen to force us to pay for food that wasn’t received. Not the kind of company we want to do business with.","Date of experience: November 22, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,WF,Trust Pilot,,

"Uber eats has to be using AI as their support. I won’t believe otherwise! A few weeks ago, Uber suspended all of my promo codes. I chatted in asking what happened and the agent sent a generic copy and paste message telling me “you’ve breached our terms and can no longer use promo codes”. I was baffled as I wasn’t aware of doing something wrong. I order as normal, use promo codes when they are available, haven’t asked for a refund on anything but a 50cent sauce in probably 6 months or more, and haven’t really had any issues in general. I was a bit confused by this statement. I asked the agent what term I’ve breached and he ended the chat. I chatted back in, asked the agent what term I’ve breached, and he copied and pasted the exact message the first agent pasted, stating I’ve breached a term. Yes… I know… I asked him a second time, which term I breached. He told me due to their privacy laws, he cannot tell me. I asked him what I can do to rectify the situation. He ended the chat. Third time chatting back in. Asked how I can resolve the issue, and if not can Uber close my account. The agent transferred my chat to a specialist who said they would respond within 6-12 hours. Specialist emails me with the same generic “you’ve breached our term” copy paste message as the first two agents. Are you kidding me? I email back asking for my subscription to be cancelled and account to be closed. A new specialist reply’s to me saying “I’m sorry you weren’t able to apply a coupon to your pizza order from 1 month ago. Next time please reach out right away. I can’t give you any refund on the pizza. I’m glad I could resolve this for you.” Is this a joke? Is there a live human on the other end?

"I recently had a frustrating experience with UberEats that I feel compelled to share. I placed an order for groceries, including 2 pieces of chicken, beef mince, and 2 pounds of beef. However, when my order arrived, I noticed that there was 1 pound of beef missing.Naturally, I contacted UberEats customer support to request a re-delivery of the missing item. To my dismay, the customer support representative informed me that they would not be able to provide a refund or any kind of compensation for the missing beef. This was incredibly frustrating, as I had paid for the full order and expected to receive it in its entirety.To make matters worse, I had included special instructions with my order, but it seemed that the store did not bother to follow them. This left me feeling disappointed and dissatisfied with UberEats' customer support and the overall experience.I believe that when customers place orders and pay for specific items, they should receive exactly what they paid for, and if there are any issues, they should be resolved promptly and fairly. Unfortunately, my experience with UberEats fell far short of these expectations, and I am left feeling frustrated and let down by their customer support.","Date of experience: November 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Navila,Trust Pilot,,

"We order through UberEats a lot because Deliveroo is not available in our area. On a regular basis items are missing, completely inedible, or spilled/damaged. Given my experience with UberEats customer service in the past, I don't even bother claiming inedible food anymore and I just deal with it. Missing items, however, is a different story.We order at least a few times a week - sometimes small items like coffees, other times meals. Regularly a few companies (mainly McDonalds and Starbucks) do not send items. I claim them back in the app, and up until a month ago I was refunded for these items. In the last month every order I make requires a PIN, and when I tried to claim back a simple £2.39 donut that was not in the bag, I was unable to. Customer support then told me that ""we have seen that a number of orders have received price adjustments or credits"" and refused to refund me.Yes, indeed, because they were legitimately missing items. I reached out to their customer support again and again and just get a canned response over and over. No refund, despite them taking money for an item. I feel like I'm being treated as a fraudster when I regularly put up with cancelling drivers, lackluster delivery service, delayed service, and missing or terrible items.We never get any compensation for a bad driver, or a driver who is clearly picking up other orders despite our order being ready. However whenever we have a problem there's radio silence and it's somehow our fault.This is basically theft. How can I prove in a photo something is missing? Shall I take a photo of an empty countertop or an empty hand or bag? Given the amount of orders and money spent, the maths works out that I'd have a higher number of claims. Maybe UberEats needs to look at investigating restaurants which can't seem to fulfill orders or properly update their system when sending the order out that an item was missing, instead of spending time calling customers liars.If UberEats doesn't like providing legitimate refunds, and doesn't want to have decent customer support because they're in what they feel is a high fraud business, then maybe they need to rethink their business altogether.","Date of experience: November 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MW,Trust Pilot,,

We gave him back the wrong food and tried contacting Uber. They don’t have a good way of contacting them as all we kept getting was a bot response telling us to enjoy our order.

They will have the same response over and over again, and you need to repeat your issue over and over again.A few weeks ago I got an error message when I tried to activate a promotion offer, I contacted Uber Eats help line and was told that my account was restricted from using promotion because I violate their terms and conditions. I had no idea what I did wrong and none of them were able to tell me.  After about a dozen of calls and emails, someone from their priority support team was able to fix it temporary. It went well for a week and then my account was restricted from using promotion again.  After back and forth a few times, I kept getting the same response that system put a restriction to apply promotion because there is a breach of Uber Eats terms and conditions. Again they couldn't find anything to show that I have done anything wrong. I asked for the priority support team and was told there's no such team!!  Finally I got to speak with a Uber manager and was told that they will do an investigation. I asked if someone will get back to me when the investigation is completed. She said no but I can call to follow up. She said they will close my ticket as nothing more they can do. They reassure me that I can still order but without any promotion for the time being.

So, the food left the restaurant may not be as good as packed or warm enough to be served.Instead, If  few people could call the merchant and order for collection when convenient, You would probabyly get the same item cheaper more effective and warm as it should.I understand if restaurant does not offer delivery service.

Uber-moronic (full pun intended) delivery driver ignored my delivery instructions and didn't even bother to verify he was delivering to the right building, nevermind the right person.Almost $100 worth of food stolen. They don't even have a Support phone number or Live Chat for PC you can reach to rectify an issue quickly. Instead you gotta wait 1-2 days for them to respond to your message, receive a bot-generated reply or roll the dice with their Self-Help options of the Order Help section.I got my money back even though I would've preferred to get my FOOD. If I were the paranoid type, I'd think I'm being scammed in order to make me reorder & have to pay the full un-discounted amount.

Used to order Uber Eats after a long hiatus. The experience was very convenient. It's picks up the nearest restaurant and provides the menu to choose with all the customize options. The delivery was also very prompt. Two points which need work. There is a lot of premium above the price. The price of the dish has a premium. The delivery fee and the tip gets added making the overall experience very unattractive. The second point is that there was a promo applicable but it did not apply. So one can use this service for the convenience at a significant premium,"Date of experience: November 19, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,AB,Trust Pilot,,
"I used UberEats for the first the other night. I ordered fast food from Chipotle & paid extra for promptness...the delivery went smoothly & all was well. Because it went so smoothly I decided to order dessert through UberEats... this time the experience made me never want to try again. The driver messaged me that he picked up my order but it was the wrong order & then asked for my code to close out the delivery because he wasn't able to remove it & close it without my code. Well, I said no. I had been charged for the dessert, delivery, & tip & wasn't going to receive what I purchased. After dealing with his many messages & excuse that he didn't speak English & watching the app continue to push my delivery time out (as if he was coming which I knew he wasn't because he said & I was watching him drive other places on the map) I continued to battle your chat bot that wouldn't allow me to do anything as your system still thought it was coming & so I didn't click to cancel for fear that I would be blamed & charged & never get my purchase or a refund. Eventually something in your Chatbot changed (.5hrs later) & I was allowed to chat with a human who said they would cancel the order & I would receive full refund. Thankfully, after eating 45 min of my time on a dessert i never got I did receive a full refund.i do not see myself trying your service ever again. Give 2 stars because it went well first time & I did eventually receive refund,  but not until after I battled chatbot for 45 minutes.","Date of experience: November 19, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,SS,Trust Pilot,,

"Today I received the worst customer service ever. I ordered items from Macdonalds app and they referred me to Uber Eats(who should deliver my order). Address and all the details was correct and I choose the option”hand to me”. When I saw on order tracking that driver was near my flat, the driver called me and asked where am I and that he is waiting for me near traffic lights on the main road. I explained the address to him once again and he started screaming at me. He was screaming and talking rude to me. In conclusion, I just went outside to find him, I was walking all along the road but couldn’t find him. He called me again and continued screaming at me, I told him to cancel my order and request a refund. But he just marked this order as delivered and disappeared. After that I was calling to Uber Eats customer support and told them all what happened, as a result they just said they can’t give me a refund because it was an order from Macdonalds and the fact that Uber Eats cooperated with them to deliver my order can’t make any change to it. So be careful and if your drivers name is Ganiu Mobolaji Y. leave a complaint on him.

They claim they understand my frustration and gave me 20% credit to future orders. 20% credit for future orders doesn't solve the problem of the wait and receiving terrible food because of the wait.","Date of experience: November 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Janeva Lucy,Trust Pilot,,

"UberEats has just been great overall. Actually, since I started using UberEats, I completely stopped using DoorDash. Part of it is that I have the UberOne membership, and another is that they seem to offer more deals toward purchases. The overall service I get is also a lot better. For example, my orders are most often brought directly to my door (even though I live on the 4th floor), and this NEVER happened with DoorDash. Regardless of delivery instructions, Doordash would often call when they were approaching and request that I come downstairs to meet them. UberEats typically only calls if they're having trouble locating my address (which has only happened once) and they always follow my delivery instructions.

I ordered a meal and driver never arrived, eventually delivered to a wrong address and then when complained to customer service got a staged reply that it was my fault because the driver made two phone call while waiting with the food so they won't refund. This was blatant lie and a total disregard to law as the driver never phoned or never came to my house and I had security camera footage to proof that.

"I know that Uber Eats has replaced Cornershop. I just think that I had an excellent experience with Cornershop. I had a personal shopper who hand-picked my groceries and later delivered them to me. With Uber Eats, the experience was just horrible. I got products that were completely rotten. I opened the arugula salad and the smell was just horrible; the salad was black and rotten, and the box was open on top of it. The avocado was black inside. I couldn't use even half of it, and the same quality basil -completely rotten. The box of strawberries - the same story. I trashed it half of it.

"I’ve had good experiences so far, but when you use your 50% promotion on an order which never arrives after an hour late and get told it’s not eligible for a refund that’s insane behaviour by your customer care. I wanted to order food before a concert and the driver took way longer than expected, then stayed in one random spot on the map for ages before coming to me. It showed he picked up the order on the map supposedly but when he got to mine he claimed to be lost so I went to meet him downstairs of the apartment complex. Then he proceeds to tell me with broken English that he doesn’t have my food because the “app never showed him where to pick it up?” He “tried” calling uber support but it said his number was blocked which was a great red flag. Basically he stole my food but because he marked it as delivered and he did pick it up (for himself), uber customer support refuses to refund me which I think is outrageous. Why wouldn’t you take your customer’s side on this? I am so confused. I even took a picture of the guy as proof and that’s not enough?","Date of experience: November 14, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,EM,Trust Pilot,,

"The delivery has been as expected with my first and second order with UberEats. My best recommendation for users is to add as much stuff you want or need per order, so you get more delivered for the same price. First time got three days worth of Chinese food. Second time only ordered one thing. Noticed the delivery fee was the same for 8 items as it was for one. So best advice is compile a list and get as much as you can order at one time, makes the delivery cost go down per item, same end cost. It has been great so far, just giving good solid advice from my short experience.","Date of experience: November 11, 2023",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,MF,Trust Pilot,,
"If I could give the 0 stars, I would. Uber Eats customer service is nonexistent. They engage in fraudulent billing practices including double billing for an order. When asked to speak to a supervisor, they simply tell you that they are in a meeting (24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year apparently.) When asked to speak to accounting, they tell you they don’t have an accounting department. That might explain the fraudulent charges, right? You might actually speak to a person, but that person reads from a script & cannot fix, resolve or explain any issues. When they can’t use their script, they hang up on you.

Food arrived freezing cold way to cold to eat, Icecream melted that it was now just pure milk, drink spilt everywhere all over straws and other drink, had to bin the food as it was the disgusting and cold that if was to eat probably would of gotten ill! Called Uber eats back up like the man said to do, first women couldn’t find any of my information as she was obviously typing in wrong even though she told us they we were the ones saying it wrong? (It’s my details I can’t say it wrong) called back to find someone else second women found me and put me on hold for 10 minutes to then come back and tell me that they aren’t going to refund, no partial refund, no credit nothing. For food that was inedible? I told the women that is it ridiculous and she told me she understood, she obviously didn’t understand as I would of had a refund, I then asked to speak to a manager he then said they only do refunds if I cancelled the order before restaurant accepts?! Like what the hell? I told him I called up before to cancel due to waiting and then couldn’t as it was then on its way, he said the same thing over and over which was just complete bloody rubbish. So next time if I order of Uber eats and my food is cold I must remember to order and then cancel before I get my food because of course I will no what my food is going to be like, bloody ridiculous.

Our order was cancelled because the driver claimed he tried to contact us and waited out side for over 7 minutes and we didn't contact him. This is utter lies. He was not there when I went outside. He would not answer his phone and the tracker showed him to be no where near our house. He didn't ring the door bell or knock at the door or call me. Uber eats have charged us and will not engage. They keep saying the driver waited even though I have told them I have proof he didn't. They have also tried to say my address was wrong but that is also lies.

"UberEats is the WORST delivery service in the UK. Highly recommended using Deliveroo or JustEat as their customer service is fair when things go wrong. UberEats just sends automated message after automated message, regardless of the situation. Don't waste your money or your time with them, but if you already have and aren't getting what you need - I recommend doing a chargeback through your bank to get your money back. Delete the app! I ordered food, restaurant began preparing it, driver was assigned, driver was cancelled, yet I received the stone cold food almost an hour later despite the PROMISE TIME being 32 minutes prior to its arrival. It went straight in the bin, disgusting. But the ""customer service"" was the worst part of the whole experience. They keep offering 40% off codes because they are desperate - on its way out of the UK hopefully! We don't need it.","Date of experience: November 12, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,UC,Trust Pilot,,
"Only a 1 star as couldn't leave a '0'.Worst customer services I've ever encountered and completely ripped off after being charged for food we were never going to recieve as restaurant confirmed driver left without it and then after 1 hour and 40 minutes still not allocated to another. As we were in an office block we had to cancel as could not have it arrive freezing cold several hours after ordering (as advised by restaurant) uber refused to accept any fault and charged us for the food £17 for something we would never recieve,  when we buy several takeaways per week as well as having uber one. All memberships now cancelled as well as emails and all notifications,  atleast with just eat you know where you stand and are not ripped off after being incredibly loyal customers.","Date of experience: October 27, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KD,Trust Pilot,,
Uber eats refused to give me a refund for a double charged order. I sent an order and right after a minute I realized that I have to add more to the order because the buy 1 get 1 wouldn't applied automatically if yoou don't order 2 of the same item so I cancelled it right away and re ordered the same exact things. Just added a drink The ordered wasn't even started preparing yet when I cancelled. And then later on I realized that they charged me double with 2 diffferent amounts. So I was gonna asked for help on the chat but there was message saying that i have a pending charge and have to wait 5-10days to solve the issue. So i waited for few days and when I followed up they said that 48 hours have passed so there's no way I can get my money back. But they knew that I was charged twice fir tge same order. It was $43 that just went to waste. And the customer service peopple are so rude as well. I will NEVER order again from uber eats.

"Don't do it. You can't review restaurants - even though you see some reviews listed - they are usually just good ones. There is no way to write one of your own, so I don't know where they get the ones you see. Nor is there any way listed to contact Uber customer service, even though I belong to Uber One. You seem to have to go through their twitter page, and I'm not joining that mess just to contact them. You shouldn't have to search all over the place to find a way to contact them, it should be right on the app page and easy to find. It's a rip-off and a joke. Most of my orders come botched. Even when rating a restaurant with the thumbs up or down, they really don't let you give an accounting of why you're giving a thumbs down, they just give a few suggestions from which to choose. The prices are way too high, restaurants have really taken advantage of pandemic pricing, it's gross. Even though I realize Uber doesn't set the prices, the service itself is so crappy it's not worth joining. They are uninterested in whether you have a good experience, and since that is the essence of customer service, I highly recommend you stay clear.","Date of experience: November 12, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Gigi Kitten,Trust Pilot,,

Hoping this helps people. See below for review. I asked my bank to do a charge back which they did. Apparently Uber eats rarely challenge them so if your complaint is genuine and you won't use them again. Try that. They say I've had too many refunds so they absolutely will not reimburse me for the 5 missing items totalling around £30. This company is a scam and should be shut down!

This company is a farce. I ordered something through them but the app for some reason changed to delivery address to a few doors down. I tried contacting uber - they said to contact the delivery person to give him correct address and then send him a message too. I sent him a message before he arrived at the pick up point and while he was there too. I tried to phone him 3 times but he didn't pick up. When he got to the wrong address he messages me saying he wouldn't come to me and then immediately left with the order.  I asked him why don't you pick the phone up he messaged saying he didn't understand English and only speaks Portuguese! I complained to uber but they refused to reimburse. Disgusting- a company that shouldn't exist.,"Date of experience: November 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,HM,Trust Pilot,,
"Just ordered a pizza. Waited outside the door and driver claimed my road was closed which it wasn’t. So he did not deliver my food even though the tracker showed him to be 1min away. He took off with my food and claimed to have delivered it which he clearly didn’t. Customer services are online and didn’t want to know. I got a picture of a pizza box chucked on the kerbside near a puddle of filthy Easter as proof that my food had been delivered. I am fuming right now, as this was going to be my first meal of the day.","Date of experience: November 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,A falling Guy,Trust Pilot,,
"Im submitting as this rubbish has occurred more than once in a short space of time and refuse to accept this as coincidence. See screenshots of my most recent abysmal experience. I order some food from Burger King via Uber eats app. Around 40 minutes later the rider calls me and says “the restaurant says they dont have your order” at which point I’m asking “what does that mean for me and what are expecting me to do about it since I don’t work for your company” he then says “one second” and hangs up… below is a transcript of the bizzarre ordeal with customer service…this is how uber eats treats customers, so god knows how their employees are treated. 2 hours later I have a deliveroo order instead. This is not the first time this sort of horrendous customer treatment has happened from uber eats so I assume there are real problems with this whole operation. I urge all to submit their terrible experiences unless we are all growing tolerant of the execs of these big companies treating the public like this whilst laughing all the way to the bank.Advisor 1: Hi (my name)Me: Your driver has contacted me saying that the restaurant i ordered from dont have my orderI have already waited far too longI need you to find out from this restaurant what they are doingAdvisor 1: I'm sorry to hear about your issue.

I'm going to try contact the restaurant partner and will get back to you in two minutesMe: Ok thanksAdvisor 1: I am still trying to connect, I hope to update you in the next 2 minutes.Advisor 1: I have tried contacting the restaurant partner but unfortunately, I am unable to get in touch with them.Advisor 1: I've gone ahead and cancelled this order. Rest assured you were not charged for this order.Advisor 1: Is there anything else I can help you with?Me: Did you contact your delivery employee?Me: Hello?Advisor 1: I confirm that your order has been canceled and you are not charged for if.Thank you for your understanding and for reaching out to support.

I said that your delivery guy called me saying that burger king dodnt have my orderMe: I saw a message saying the order was with the rider, so did you check that the rider managed to get the order in the end?Advisor 2: I understand that this has been inconvenient and that you were not hoping for this outcome, but I appreciate you letting us know about this.Advisor 2: I understand that this has not been a great experience, but please know that this is not a regular occurrence and I hope your next experience would be a better one.Advisor 2: You can place a new order now.Me: All I want is an answer to my question. What has happened please?Me: Its important for companies to be transparent with customers. So it is reasonable for you to explain what has happened…Advisor 2: Your order was cancelled by one of our agent without asking from you.Advisor 2: This was indeed not the type of experience we strive for, but there can be unusual situations like these which are contrary to the expectations.Me: I know that, but did the rider actually manage to get my order?Me: Can you find out please?Advisor 2: I understand that this is not the outcome you were hoping for. Unfortunately, I am unable to look into this matter any further.Thank you for reaching out to support. Have a nice day ahead.CHAT ENDED BY ADVISOR 2Advisor 3: Hi (my name)Me: This whole chain is going to be posted publicly unless I get an answer to my questionAdvisor 3: Sorry to hear about thatAdvisor 3: I can see your order has been already marked as canceled nad you will be not charged for this order.Me: This is ridiculousAdvisor 2: Rest assured there is no charge for the order, But if you do see any charge right now than please know that the charge you are seeing is likely an authorization hold and will release back to your account shortly.Me: Are you an actual person?Advisor 3: I will immediately forward this information to the dedicated team who will come back to you as soon as possible.Chat transferred: This conversation has been sent to another team. An agent will do their best to answer within 6 to 12 hours.What do we make of this? Are these people clicking on pre-populated answers??

It was at least a £50 order that had turned up, and had nothing in it that I’d ordered. I rang the delivery driver immediately to tell him that I’d been given the wrong bag, but all he kept saying was ‘I don’t know what you want me to do’ and was absolutely no help at all.I then got in touch with Uber directly, who sent me a snotty generic response saying that because I’d been given a refund before on a missing item before they wouldn’t be doing anything to rectify the problem. So you’re telling me that it’s my fault that they keep messing up that badly, missing items and having to offer refunds? Once again, I stated to them that I wasn’t looking for a refund, but that somebody else had been given my order and I’d gotten there’s which must have left them extremely out of pocket given the size of the order! 5 minutes later I got another generic response, saying that they were closing the case now and encouraged me to leave a review about my experience.What an absolute joke this company is, I don’t know how they’re still being aloud to operate when they’re messing people around like this with such poor customer service.

"Uber always had wrong map for my home. The delivery guys with cars always go back door and there is no entry. My house is really easy to find. Finally, I wrote to Uber eats a month back to rectify that. Added, instructions to find my home easily, very clear instructions, few drivers after that when they called, I asked them to see the instructions if it helps or else I will come. It worked last few times. Today, I ordered and the driver called up after half n hour, I instructed on call, asked him to follow the instructions written, messaged him on app. He cancelled the order and left. After all this, when I reported, Uber eats informed me, the records say driver contacted me. And then closed the chat, the only way to reach out to them. I never said driver didn’t contact me. No refund, no apologies, doesn’t matter, I have already cancelled my monthly subscription and now I am deleting my app too. Never thought this way, but there should be -ve stars ⭐️ too for review. If the driver or at-least customer service one of them were helpful, I would have let it go but m done with Uber eats. I have never in my life written -ve review, thanks Uber eats to make me learn this.","Date of experience: November 07, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Vineet Verma,Trust Pilot,,

"The most rubbish and unprofessional food delivery and customer service on world!I have placed an order and waited for 1 hour to send, and finally it arrived with a completely someone else's order. And I returned the item to the driver and took picture, went to the app and tried to contact Uber the wrong order received, but the app doesn't allow me to upload the image? Rubbish app! So I had to contact the customer service, I told him I have received someone's order and he needs to reorder for me, because I used a £15 off welcome code, if I reorder again, the system won't let me use again this £15 off welcome code. BUT, the Uber customer service simply refunded me and ended the chat by himself! Without even asking if I am happy with the solution he offers!!! And he ended the chat himself while I am still typing! What an unprofessional customer service!!!! And then I reopened more chats, and no one gets back to me. I just need Uber to reorder for me with the £15 off discount, and so far no one resolve this for me and Uber customer service don't even bother to respond.

"I ordered from a local restaurant from Uber Eats for a scheduled delivery about an hour and a half in advance.   The restaurant is only a 10-15 minute drive from my home. An hour before the delivery window approached, I received a notification that the restaurant accepted the order. I called the restaurant. They said there was no future time on the order and they would begin working on it. I asked them to delay it. They called me back a few minutes later and said that the Uber driver would be arriving 40 minutes in advance of the delivery window to pick up the order and they needed to start work on it. I told them I was going to cancel the order.When I got on the app, I was able to cancel the order, but I was informed that because the restaurant had accepted the order and began preparing it, I would be charged so the restaurant could be paid.There was no way Support were going to refund the monies.The problem as I saw it was the app or the Uber Eats process of releasing the order prematurely. I didn't want it early for a cold dinner. There is no way for me to complain to Uber for this issue, thus I must resort to this review to complain and hope that they will fix the process. I won't be using Uber again.","Date of experience: November 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,RD,Trust Pilot,,

After a couple of seconds I wrote I think I heard you. I looked through the balcony and saw a motorbike. It was pretty far from the building where I live. He said ""Come down and get it"" It was very rude but I did not care. ı said you seem like you are at the wrong place but I will come down anyway. I immediately went down and saw that it was not him again immediately. I have called him multiple times and he did not pick up. He has taken a photo of the order standing in the middle of a random street. I have searched for my order on the streets in cold for half an hour. I could not find it. Please could you tell me if is this normal? It is acceptable? You are saying that the delivery partner tried to contact you and waited long enough. ?No he has not. He has not.

For one they are difficult to get a hold of and the means that they have provided for contact are inadequate.They have drivers who barely speak English language, nevermind read it; this becomes an irritant of a problem when retrieving food ordered. Some are quite unprofessional, poorly dressed and not at all versed in handling items of food e.g they're not kept warm during transit.The list goes on and it as if their motto is ""If you don't like it lump it"".It's quite terrible, more times than not.I find myself thinking gosh, they must know me by name by now, the amount of complaints I've tried to raise.

"A Chinese restaurant I often order from advertised ‘2 for 1’ on a few items. I ordered sesame chicken and expected a charge that represented the reduced cost - but NO!  Uber calculates their ‘service fee’ as though I had paid full price for two. And also calculated the tip on the higher cost - and then deducted the half price. So Uber DOUBLES their income.

Ordered a five guys at 5:30 the app said it would be 25 mins. 1 and a half hours later the food hasn’t even left the restaurant. I tried to contact the delivery driver they had appointed only to find her phone was off. Then to try and resolve the issue you get an automated chat that is absolutely no help at all. Absolutely shocking service and will certainly not be TRYING to use. I say trying as my food didn’t even leave the restaurant.

"First and last time I'll use Ubereats.  Food was running 20 minute behind the latest expected time, no big deal it happens, but we were listening out for it.  Got a phonecall with an automated message saying Ubereats driver was trying to contact me, but no option to speak the driver?!My partner went straight out the front door to look for him but no sign.  I got an e-mail receipt 30 seconds later saying the food have been delivered to number 7, I live at number 34 and you could clearly see the correct address on the initial order.  It wasn't in the garden of number 7 either (just across the road from us so we'd have seen a car pull up if that's where it had been left). and the photograph doesn't match the garden of where it was supposedly delivered to.  Despite having photographic evidence of the food being dumped at the wrong address and the driver recording it as being delivered to the wrong house number, Ubereats still refused to refund!Edit: If you order through Paypal you can't open a dispute if you don't receive your order.  Also Uber set up an automated payment on my Paypal, which they didn't cancel once they'd already taken the initial payment, so beware of them taking duplicate transactions.  I'll be closing my account and double checking my bank statements as I don't trust this awful, dishonest company.  Fortunately I was able to get a refund from the restaurant as we order from them regularly (unfortunately they stopped taking orders through Deliveroo hence using Ubereats).  However, I'm shocked at the appalling service from Ubereats, especially being accused of lying and giving the wrong address/phone number on the order. Also apparently it's perfectly fine to dump food in random people's gardens and call it a delivery service!

Rang Uber and they said there was a miscommunication but that my groceries were definitely getting delivered. A driver called me to ask for the pin code saying they need it to cancel the order. I gave it to him thinking they would sort it out. I asked him what's going to happen next, is he gonna reorder, are the groceries with him, is he coming to my house? He wouldn't answer properly.

"They used to have really good customer service but it is now one of the worst experiences I have ever had. It takes ages to get through to a human and then you are met with utter disregard, and individuals who ignore your points, do not address what you are saying or asking for and are wholly unhelpful. My order was repeatedly delayed when they couldn’t find a driver despite my food being ready which then sat there for over 40 minutes. I asked them to cancel since they couldn’t deliver it and I was just told to keep waiting and eventually someone will bring it. By this point I had given up and started making myself dinner it had been so long. I continued to ask to cancel and be refunded but the agent was like speaking to a brick wall continually spewing the same rhetoric lacking any real apology or empathy for their shoddy service. He attempted to blame the driver and when I was allocated a driver the app told me that they were actually going to complete another delivery first before bringing my food. By this point my food was surely rock hard but again the customer service agent didn’t care and when I asked for their name to include in my review they promptly ended the chat with me and didn’t answer any of my remaining concerns.  By far the worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Their username was msidiq1. Needless to say, my food showed up cold and rock hard and went straight in the bin. (Pad Thai with the noodles had formed an inseparable block). I once again flagged this and was given some money off but still had to pay £5 for this inedible block and the time I wasted speaking to their shoddy customer service agent. Beyond belief!! If they simply cancelled the £12 order and refunded me when it hasn’t left the restaurant this could have all been avoided.","Date of experience: November 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,RE,Trust Pilot,,

I use time to time uber eats like most of people but lately I am very disappointed to be fair. Drivers don't pick full order bringing all poured out its disaster. Most of the time I pay extra for priority but orders are late and arriving messy with missing parts of orders. Yes I do get my money back from restaurants but what about what I paid for delivering?nothing? Like today I order McDonalds breakfast in total I paid over £13 . I received only coffee and that one was poured all over bag. I did refund from macies but only £7 so it means £6 I paid for what? For someone pretending that they do they job. Very disappointed. You should refund people who receive damaged or not full stuff. In the end of the day it is driver's duty to make sure that they pick full order I mean check receipt before they goes and bring it not damaged (which in my case driver looked very surprised that I ordered food even he clearly could read on receipt and bag he brought me clearly was only coffee and by the way leaking) unfortunately they do not do refund in my knowledge and this very disappointing as to me it happens way too often.

After calling the restaurant, he assures me that it's being prepared and will be delivered. and at 1AM I receive a message that my order could not be delivered.

"Uber eats is a great service but can be rather expensive when including the service fee, delivery fee and the obvious extra price hikes on food in comparison to ordering directly from the takeaway. One thing that they have always offered though is discount codes and promotions sent via email promotions, unfortunately it seems that recently these promotions are all pure marketing tactics which include “fake” discounts.I have recently received no fewer than four separate offers for discounts on food delivery with the latest being 50% off which even tempted me to join Uber one to save a little on deliveries as the offer could be used 5 times. Luckily I didn’t as the promotion along with the previous three is available to use at no stores. After searching for a support number I contacted Uber eats support via X where a team member was happy to help, I confirmed my account details and sent proof of my payment card and eagerly awaited a response. After no reply after a few hours I messaged again… and again… and again to continuously be ignored for several days now. I have been searching for contact details on how to make an official complaint regarding false advertisement and marketing but have failed so far, I shall continue to search for any kind of contact details while I enjoy a delicious take away delivered by Deliveroo.","Date of experience: October 31, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MJ,Trust Pilot,,

This went on until 7:30 when a driver was finally assigned, saying it would be delivered at 7:45 because he had to deliver to someone else first. Obviously the food arrived stone cold and milkshakes melted. We phoned customer service who were no help at all and seem to think because they delivered within 55 minutes there's not an issue. We paid £27 for food and drinks that were inedible. They said they can't refund us, get in touch with McDonald's. McDonald's said it's Uber Eats that need to refund.

Placed a simple order for McDonalds. Wrong delivery arrives. Spent an hour on the phone to Uber Eats being passed round the world. Still didn't get an answer. No refund eventually gave in.

"Ordered off McDonald’s app which uses Uber eats. Delivery time got changed late, but seems like food was cooked for original time as it arrived stone cold and missing a burger. Called customer service who was rude, argued that there was nothing they can do as they delivered within the second time slot as they had to changed drivers. Clearly because of this my food was cold, but nope not their fault. Only accepted to refund missing item within 15 days, but weren’t doing anything about the cold food despite us refusing to eat it and telling them to send the driver back to collect it. They were patronising towards my mother; they asked me to read the order number out but when trying to see which number it was my mother beat me to it. They kept saying she was an intelligent woman over and over, just for reading a number out, so we didn’t appreciate that. They clearly didn’t have many brains cells asking me to repeat my name and number numerous times it became a joke, clearly not listening and just reading off his cue cards. No email to complain to, just the help line with useless staff struggling with a language barrier.","Date of experience: November 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,LB,Trust Pilot,,

"Most horrible experience ever, you order your food and then it's in a black hole, the estimated delivery time just moves forward, the map which is supposed to show your driver shows a picture of a car not moving for 1h, and sometimes just shows your location for half an hour, with no driver at all, no transparency, and during the time of waiting for the food I would manage both to cook it myself AND go to a restaurant. Waiting over an hour and still no idea where my food is or if it's coming at all. It's not a delivery of a wardrobe, when people order food they are typically hungry! I also read the driver can drop your order any time, they are just polling for drivers like for taxis. Totally unreliable system.Update - so I got my food and the bill with the times. The restaurant took 30 minutes and the driver took 50 minutes to drive 5 km by car. He basically started driving a few mins before the latest delivery time, from a city part that has nothing to do with the restaurant.","Date of experience: November 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Mona Moni,Trust Pilot,,

That was the end of it.It would appear that Uber Eats is more than happy to take your money and as long as they deliver something. It doesn’t matter what it is- or even the correct order.

"I used Uber to order a set menu from KFC (New Lynn) that included 16 pieces of chicken. A number of chickens that are not usually counted.  I was hungry so I started eating right away. That day, I looked into the bucket and saw a lot of chicken wings. I got annoyed and counted how many chicken wings there were, and I found out that the total number of chickens was 14. With the mindset that I had to contact Uber quickly, I stopped eating even though I couldn't even eat two, took a picture to keep as evidence, and started writing a complaint. Meanwhile, the chickens, chips and potato gravy I ordered were all cold. It's winter, so the food gets cold while it's being delivered to your house. Can't you imagine what the hot food will be like after all the time it took to take out all the chickens in the bucket, arrange them side by side so they can be seen clearly in the photo, take pictures, and write the application form. I was so irritated that all desire to eat disappeared. I threw away all that food. And asked for a refund. The above is all included in the message I wrote while requesting help from Uber. Uber's response came the next day, not the same day. The result was truly shocking. Refund NZ$7.41. Could it be that the price of two chickens is NZ$7.41? So refund this price??  Uber's action to end the situation by only returning the price of two chickens. This is so absurd. I ended up violating my right to enjoy the food I ordered using Uber, but they don't seem to feel sorry at all. Don't try to solve problems like this, where consumers are harmed and where it is not the consumer's fault at all. Don't fool consumers like this.

Driver marked order as complete even after admitting he brought wrong order. Called shop and they said driver picking up right order second time but never arrived.

"They will not refund my money. I ordered food from a restaurant and they did not deliver one of the items. The restaurant even wrote on the receipt sorry they ran out. I called the restaurant and they said i had to contact ubereats directly. I contacted ubereats on the same day i received the order to report the missing item. I was contacted by a rep to state a refund of £2.40 had been processed however the item I paid for was £8. I immediately messaged back snd stated the correct price and asked for confirmation that £8 had been refunded, they responded with a generic ""your refund has been processed"" without confirming the amount.Lo and behold £2.40 is refunded to my card so I go back to the supoort message to escalate, they respond and say they cant refund me as it is now passed 48hours and i shouldve reported the issue then. I confirmed that I did this and sent them screenshots of the conversations where i asked for confirmation of the correct amount etc.I then received a message from support saying they had reviewed my case and would receive a refund within 3 to 10 working days, its now been 3 weeks since.Ive contacted ubereats againg today to complain to receive the same BS response about 48 hours. I dont care whether its a small amount to me its the principle that you have not refunded me the money i paid for an item that was not received and was also confirmed by the restaurant that it wasnt sent.I feel robbed.

Manager gave me UberEats number and I got the canned, ""sorry"" response. Meanwhile, it's Friday night with a hungry guest and I have no dinner. UberEats is terrible and I will no longer use.

He repeatedly asked where I was and I couldn’t tell him other than the info he already had. After nearly 4 minutes of his abuse I hung up. A short while later he delivered items. There was no sugar and sweetener as requested (I’d moved so didn’t have any) - the toasted sandwich was squashed next to the cake, which was warmer than the toastie.I couldn’t eat any of order and repeated contact attempts resulted in generic messages informing someone would be in touch. This further annoyed me and I asked for a full refund. No reply but 12 hours later, I got an email stating refund… upon checking I had been refunded £1.25.. not the £16… nothing I ordered was £1.25 & delivery was free so am unclear what this was.I am clear about contacting my bank to do a charge back and never using Uber Eats again.","Date of experience: October 27, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,HL,Trust Pilot,,

"Our foodcwas delivered virtually stone cold and we had items missing from order. It had taken the driver 36 minutes to travel what should have been barely a mile but route was convoluted due to doing other deliveries en route. The first items the driver brought to our door was a grocery order that was for someone else. It took him 5 minutes to go back to his car and swap the groceries for our order. Food delivered by Uber but ordered via McDonald's app. Although I ordered directly from the Mcdonald app, they won't do anything about it because it was delivered by Uber, I have to raise my complaint through Uber. I phoned Uber and they only accept calls for people with orders that haven't yet been delivered. Other than that, you need to raise the complaint on line. I downloaded their app but there is no option to raise the complaint as I didn't do my order through their app. So I went to the Uber site. I haven't used the Uber site to order food for at least 2 years and, to be able to raise a complaint, I have to input a code that they have sent to my old email account which I have no way of accessing. I have changed the email to my new email but, again, a code is sent to my old email before they will accept it. I will NEVER order a delivery via Uber again.

The amount was $42.00 and he took the money praising me as he bowed all the way back to his car. It wasn't until the penny dropped for me, that I realized that Uber take the money from your bank account when you place the order. Thumbs down to that driver who did not even question me why I was paying him. Naughty Uber driver.

The driver apparently waited 12 minutes but he was never in the right place to start with and he never rang us to let us know he was lost or needed guiding to our house which is really not hard to find as it’s a detached house with a very clear door number on our front door.

"Almost every time I order from McDonald's, there is at least one item missing or wrong. I understand that that in itself isn't directly uber eats fault but when my order was missing one of the burgers in a combo meal, I was only refunded £1.94 while the stand alone value for the burger on it's own is £6.49. When I brought this issue up, the only response I received was, ""We've looked into this for you and can see that you have already been refunded for this order."" It just really feels like adding insult to injury. Really not impressed especially as uber eats is certainly on the more expensive side in refunded to delivery and service charges.

"I placed an order to a store that was closed. Apparently they informed Uber they wasn't taking orders, yet my order still went through. When the Uber drive arrived at the store he phoned me and told me it was closed. He then said that I need to cancel the order which I physically couldn't do. But he needed to complete the order to continue working. So I had to confirm delivery for the order because there was no way for me to cancel it. I then couldn't request a refund because I confirmed delivery, after finally being able to email them, they kept responding saying I'm not entitled to a refund. After emailing them many times that all they need to do is phone the store and the delivery guy who would both confirm the store was closed. After eventually drilling through to someone that I paid for a service which I never received, they turned around and eventually refunded me. However, they worded the email in such away to make it seem like I was in the wrong for example ""To make things right, I’ve gone ahead and refunded you £25.33 for the entire order as a goodwill gesture."", ""Please remember that this is a deviation from our normal policy under these circumstances, so I may not be able to offer the same outcome again in the future.""

I kept receiving unable to complete order messages which led to an online chat with one of their customer service representatives who instructed me to sign out and uninstall, then re-install the app. When that didn’t work, I was informed to try ordering on a web browser, which worked. However, when the driver arrived, I was informed that due to liquor being delivered he would have to “scan” a piece of i.d. I refused, and he went on his merry way. Wouldn’t “showing” this person a piece of i.d. suffice? What’s with the “scanning” element. It just does not seem secure to me.

"Should give this 0 stars but there’s not an option for that..So I ordered a McDonald’s delivery using the McDonald’s app (it says powered by UberEats). The delivery driver tracker on the app showed him (KAMRAN A was my drivers name) as being outside, had a call from him to say he’s outside and I told him I’d be right there (for context I live in shared accommodation so had to make my way to the main door of the building to meet the driver for my food). I reach outside with no one with a delivery to be seen. He then phones back again saying he doesn’t know where he is, first something about a car park then something about a museum that was further up my street. Explained to him he’s too far up the street and gave him the name on a sign right opposite where I was and that I knew he’d be able to see from where he was but he still said he doesn’t know. Then says “I’m cancelling your order” and hung up on me. Tried to call him back but got no answer. It then said “order delivered” on my McDonald’s app but no delivery in my possession. Phoned McDonald’s and they told me to phone Uber Eats, phoned Uber Eats and they told me they cannot refund me or put credit on my Uber account even after explaining the whole situation too them and knowing I should be entitled to a refund due to not receiving what I’ve paid for. DO NOT USE UBER EATS! Whether it’s the McDonald’s app, another app they power or the Uber Eats app themselves, their policies are a joke sounds like something a 1 year old would have made up.

It was food for my 2 children as a treat. I tried ringing and texting the uber driver multiple times, but you can clearly tell it's not a proper number. It took ages to connect and always went to voicemail, the provider none of us have ever heard of. Rang mcdonald's, they couldnt do anything, rang uber, couldn't understand a word that was said from either of the 2 people I spoke to. Their accents are so thick and they speak so fast you literally can't make out a word they're saying.I've heard numerous stories of uber drivers making off with people's food, selling it on the side and making out they delivered it, but I never expected it to happen to me! It was a very rare treat, which I don't have the money to buy another mcdonald's for my very very dissapointed children!I really don't understand how these people get away with doing it? Shouldn't they be vetted or something before being hired? This is people's hard earned money they're taking away, food from children, a very rare treat for a family who have had a very very rough few months. Disgusting.","Date of experience: October 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,LO,Trust Pilot,,

"In addition to exorbitant fees and surcharges, their customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. Yesterday I opened the app, saw I had a 40% off promo expiring in 2 days. Chose from the eligible restaurants and applied it at checkout. Everything worked until the last screen where it said the promo was not being applied. The order ended up going through but the promo was removed. So I ended up paying 20$ more than planned. This is also false advertising, I have all the screenshots. I reached out to support who told me they could not amend an open order but to return once the order as complet. I did just that and I kept getting transferred in the chat to the “specialized department”. I think I was transfered 5-6 times and they kept transferring me. Ultimately they told me the specialized team would email me back. This morning I got an email simply telling me how to apply a promo code.

"We have had multiple issues over this past year between being overcharged for quoted delivery fees, paying for priority delivery and then watching the driver go off-route into multiple neighborhoods even in opposite directions before coming to us (resulting in our order being 30min or more later than quoted & food cold), not being able to contact support & other difficulties with the app.   However, tonight sealed the deal.  We ordered from a restaurant that we order from almost weekly, and normally due to evening traffic it can take the delivery driver 30-60min to get to us once they’ve picked up.  Never been an issue before.  Well, tonight.  Katelyn picked up our order and AFTER leaving the restaurant with our food, cancels it because it’s “too far to drive”.  For 1) as an Uber Eats driver, you can see your entire route prior to accepting it.  So she should’ve thought about that before accepting.  But 2) our bigger problem is that rather than returning the food to the restaurant to be given to another driver, she STOLE our food!  We had to as a result order again, the restaurant had to make it again, and we had to wait another hour+ for our food.   THEN!!!  The driver who picked up our second order attempt texts us after picking it up, complaining about the drive being 20miles (no traffic at this point) and wanting a bigger tip.   No!  You ACCEPTED this order knowing the distance!  And then on top of that, had 4 friends in the car….one of the friends brought it to our door, not him…and they were all smoking weed that completely smelled up into our home & our food.  So to sum up.   Uber Eats let’s their drivers steal food & smoke weed & contaminate your food without consequence or compensation to us.

"Sadly, Uber Eats customer service is abominable. Uber’s acquisition of Postmates made this worse. I placed an order through Postmates in March of 2023 (Order 9B99E). They delivered the wrong order, and I let Postmates know immediately, the same day. Postmates refunded / canceled the charge right away. Everything was taken care of quickly and easily.Four months later, in July of 2023, Uber charged my card for the same order. I contacted Uber support right away, and they said they charged my card again because the original charge didn’t go through. I let them know that the original charge was canceled by Postmates because the original delivered order was wrong. Uber support said that they could not do anything for me, as I contacted them outside of the 48 hour window. I explained to them that I contacted Postmates immediately, on the same day that the wrong order was delivered - That’s why Postmates refunded / canceled the original charge. Uber support kept reiterating that they could not do anything for me, as I contacted them outside of the 48 hour window.I went back and forth with Uber support for almost three months. Finally, someone from Uber priority support was able to credit my account for the charge in October of 2023. It absolutely should not have taken that long to rectify the situation. It almost seemed like Uber did not have access to the old Postmates records.

"I have been a loyal Uber Eats customer for several years. Often spending hundreds of dollars at once, tipping on every order, and a customer who meets the driver near their vehicle to avoid the driver wasting significant time coming to my door. I have reported only two issues in the 5 years I have been soley an Unver Eats customer. I am no longer an Unber Eats customer as of today. Today I ordered from a local restaurant and the UberEats App responded that there was an error and my order had not been sent. I made a second identical order and waited for the food to be delivered. Upon delivery, the driver brought two of the same order. Upon checking the UberEats application I see I was charged for both orders and tipped the driver twice. I contacted UberEats and informed them of the issue. Despite my several attempts to explain that the error occurred only because information I received from their App they refused to reimburse me for even half of the order. UberEats just lost a very committed customer. I have not used or explored other food delivery apps but will move on after this experience.","Date of experience: October 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Desiree Demonbreun,Trust Pilot,,
"DO NOT USE I ordered and an item was missing. A pumpkin Spice Latte. It was the only reason I made the order but I added a few bits to make the order worthwhile. I don’t have a lot of money. I was made homeless after abuse and I was down. I wanted to treat myself So I tried to contact the driver first thinking he may have forgot the bag. I had two bags that had on them 1/3 and 2/3 suggesting there should be 3/3. He didn’t answer. So I went through the order connection thing to advise of missing item. After robot templates for 2 days where I just went round and round in circles, being told no refund will be allowed in this case and then going round in circles again, I finally got a human response. Yet they still wouldn’t give me a refund for £3. You may think let it go it’s only £3. But that’s a lot to someone recovering from losing everything. And I actually paid over £20 in the end for this order as I bought some extra bits. I was down and wanted a treat. They knew this as I advised them of it. I’m also going through an investigation for CA and so I needed a little bit of joy. (They also knew this in the end because I basically broke down verbally)For a huge company to be so petty to not give a very down woman £3 or whatever the coffee was, is actually disgraceful. I did all they asked. Contacted driver. Provided pics of the bags I had. But how do you take a pic of a non item. A missing item? It’s almost accusing me of lying. I won’t ever use them again. There’s no heart or compassion. They should be seriously ashamed of their “customer service”.","Date of experience: October 15, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Cj,Trust Pilot,,

"Company marks up prices of items to cover their 30% cut, often there are significant problems with orders that aren't properly addressed or even rectified, it is not worth ordering even with the 40% off promos because the 40% will only cover the taxes by the end of the minimum fee and you will most likely receive inedible or mishandled food/products in return, even when you do manage to get your order rectified and in some cases refunded, they usually don't even consider how much it impacted your experience(ex. You pay 24$+tip after charges for a subway meal but only the Sub was wrong etc, you will receive a computers determination of the original Sub price refunded before any charges, tips or anything. Which will most likely look something like 9.50$ for your 6-inch Sub. Leaving you out 15$+tip for some chips/cookies and a 500ml drink.) As close as you can come to highway robbery in consumers terms, highly recommend any other app as even food that is ready to be picked up will sit there while the driver is just outside on his phone(illegal while driving btw but what else are you supposed to do all day, your job?) or smoking in/just outside his car, rarely will they ever have proper food delivery bags anymore as uber can't exactly enforce it(or they choose not to) and your food is often just thrown somewhere in their car(a lot of the times on the floor because they take multiple orders and cram em all in there, which i want to state a lot of these orders would even be claimed by multiple accounts etc so a lot of the time your driver would drive right past you delivering your order just to drive across and deliver to a completely different address he had picked an order up for from a completely different restaurant in a different account, upon pointing this out tp Uber in their earlier stages, the support team with their tools would just say 'yea, sorry. We've helped direct the driver, he'll be there soon' as if he was lost or something and now your food is on the other side of the city in someones car dying(food literally dies it's the whole point of efficient service and standards) they don't care though because the restaurant usually gets stuck with the bill(thanks uber, really helping out small businesses with all the money you made during the pandemic and that 30% cut you take from them).

"UPDATE: UberEats now refusing to refund this order saying the driver tried contacting me. I have checked my details are correct - they are, and also can show no missed calls, and door cam footage of my husband waiting outside to receive a delivery that never arrived to our address. COMPLAINTI placed an order with a local restaurant this evening and the delivery address was incorrect (it had defaulted to the restaurant's address for delivery which should have been clear to any one that it was incorrect!) I was unable to change the address by either talking to the restaurant or attempting to contact one of the 3 different drivers who showed up on the app; when I was finally confirmed a driver, I sent him a text message as he never picked up his phone; it kept going to voicemail. Driver never contacted me despite me leaving 2 voice mail messages and a text (he replied to a text to say he was going to deliver to the address I sent him, he did not); I now have a message saying it was delivered - however it has not been delivered. Also, it is impossible to get a hold of a live rep; I had to call the restaurant support line to eventually get connected to a rep, with whom I was on hold for 15mins and then he hung up - he had all my details yet never reached out to me to ensure my issue was taken care of. That is an extremely poor customer experience.How this situation was never resolved despite me trying to get in touch with Uber Eat's customer service, who then cut me off when I was trying to resolve it on the phone, or following the steps on the app. Fortunately the restaurant is amazing, and when we called them, they rushed an order through which we ended up picking up - a hassle we were trying to avoid as we're both unwell.

"This is a review after months of being an UberOne member, and being frustrated not once, twice, or three times. But every other order I've had over the last few months. I consistently am unable to communicate with my driver. I leave extremely clear delivery instructions, and for the drivers who speak my language, it goes off great. For those (every other) who do not, I end up needing to cancel my order completely. Every time I call them (as directed by uber eats) they will pick up and say ""No english sorry."" I live in a big city apartment and there are directions necessary to find me. I don't order uber eats to spend an hour trying to find my food, and to be completely unable to communicate with my drivers is unacceptable. Please provide your drivers an AI tool that can translate directions. Otherwise, it's a service I have stopped using.Additionally, every time I reach out to suport about these issues I get snippy responses such as ""I suggest you reach out to your driver"" which I do try to call and unfortunately I don't speak a second language.

"I am an Uber One member and I didn’t get the £5 credit from the late arrival of food as the membership promised. Actually there are no clear instructions on how this promise from Uber Eats works and it was so unfortunate this happened on my order in a Friday night that the food arrived a lot later than the estimated time. I thought I would get the £5 credit automatically but NO. I started to look for support as I found this was something I should be entitled, but I couldn’t find any contact point from Uber Eats’ site or app. Support service is not open to public which is the worst from the customers’ point of view. I tried by luck to get them answered the call by calling numbers from Google search results on Monday. Got someone answered the call but they were not helpful at all and they repeatedly said to me they were unable to give me the £5 credit as my ordered was placed more than 48 hours ago and marked the issue as “resolved” though it was not. I then asked them for contact as I couldn’t find one from the site/ app’s Help section, also asked him to point out where from the instructions/ terms say Uber One members need to report the late arrival of food in within 48 hours to claim the £5 credit, he repeated the same unhelpful answer, e.g. use the site/ app’s Help section, over and over. Next they ignored my chat no matter what I asked. When they don’t value the customers, not responding and disappeared like this, I found so helpless. It was kind of cheating as the rights from what they promised can’t stand.","Date of experience: October 13, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,HE,Trust Pilot,,
"I live in manhattan in a doorman building.  I had ordered from Murray's Sturgeon today.   My building has a  doorman and one entrance on the listed address spanning an entire NYC block.  Uber supposedly requires a pin# to deliver an order.   I didn't answer my phone quickly as I was on a call.  The driver dropped my food in front of a closed door around the corner, not on my street.  He/she took a picture of this, which I later found.    They refused to refund or redeliver. Ultimately, I got a credit of $25, about half the order.    Dropped at the wrong location, didn't collect PIN#,  wouldn't refund or redeliver.   Hundreds of orders on seamless and other services, never this type of problem.

My latest experience was terrible. I was told by the driver if I ask him, he will bring my food to me. He only missed off pretty please. He kept talking over me and wouldn't listen that I couldn't walk. He eventually brought my food to me and saw I was disabled. He said some people say they're disabled just to get the food delivered to their door! He also said Uber only give them so much time to deliver. It would only have taken a few minutes to get to my flat in a lift. I have complained to Uber and they keep asking me for more details.

"When it comes to correcting an order and getting a fair treatment for cancellation, this app is problematic. First it’s nearly impossible to find a way to speak to a live agent via the app and find a contact number. I had to use google and contacted a rider support line. Secondly the app showed me a cancellation refund (minus an admin fee) but then charged me for a full cancellation. I had attempted to cancel the order because it didn’t accept an address change. But oddly enough when tried placed a fresh order at the same restaurant with the same changed address it accepted the order and attempted to charge my card which fortunately didn’t go though as they had deducted the cancellation causing the balance to drop. I really don’t want late night stress when I’m dealing with a food order struggling to find customer support, trying to change an address or navigating though a poorly laid out app.","Date of experience: October 13, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,VI,Trust Pilot,,

"I ordered for the first time yesterday as we were at work and had very little time to sort something to eat, I ordered through the mcdonald's website and it's told that the delivery would be in 15 minutes. The front door was wide open and we were moving things around the front door so was never out of earshot. It gets to 25 minutes and we are wondering whether delivery is so I go back to the website and it said it's been delivered, I try to find some information on it and I can't find anything that tells me where my order is, so I try speaking to the virtual assistant chat bot, which was absolutely useless. It did not understand what I was trying to say and rather than putting me through to somebody that would help it just kept putting me back to the beginning. I find a number for uber eats who apparently deliver this, I called expecting to just either get told where my delivery was, that there was some kind of mix up or get a redelivery. I call and I'm left on hold a number of times and I'm getting frustrated because the whole idea of this was that it was the save time, I explained to the person on the phone that I can't just be waiting on the phone, they did not offer to call me back they just kept me on hold. When they finally came back to me they told me that they were enabled to give me a redelivery or a refund, when I questioned this they said that they had proof of delivery. When I asked what proof of delivery they did not answer me initially, but later on they explained that they apparently had a photo, but they would not describe this photo at all. They also said that the driver had tried to contact me twice but I had not received any calls.I asked him to send this proof of delivery and they have said that they are not able to, and that I have to take it back to the mcdonald's chat bot.Feeling very frustrated I walked the length and breadth of the industrial estate I work on, to see if anybody else had taken delivery. No other places on the road were open apart from a self-storage place.My phone the local mcdonald's that would have delivered this and they told me that uber eats are the people that should be dealing with this, yet we ordered through the mcdonald's website so our ""contract"" is with mcdonalds, placing me in a position of perpetual run around.Something that was supposed to be saving us time had me messing around for over an hour with no resolution.Absolutely do not recommend, I feel that I've been had by crooks, and I do not expect to be in this position when ordering from a company like mcdonald's.

It's so disappointing, food is always overpriced, and almost always horrible! Ubereats has literally lowered restaurant standards, and now we pay stupidly high prices for nasty food.

Made a priority delivery so that I get my items faster. The driver was ten minutes late. Food was cold when I got it. Couldn't eat it. Contacted their customer service. They transferred me to a chat room with no assistance. Then sent a generic automatic message. Basically if your food is cold you are straight up screwed! No refund given. Incompetent customer service. Awful! They are good at taking your money and running. If you don't like the quality then tough! Awful.

"I ordered food for almost 160£. The driver dropped all the food on the street, and asked me to eat it from there, he also mentioned he is vegan and he doesn’t care about the situation. I try to contact Uber eats by phone, of course no one answer, because they deal only with ongoing orders, and my order was shown cancelled by me. Totally untrue. I contacted them via chat, and also called the restaurant to contact the Uber eats restaurant support. The restaurant manager ask the Uber eats operator to contact me, and he did, but he didn’t offer any support. He didn’t care at all. I haven’t been refunded, and now after 6 days, the customer service reply to me and are telling me that they can’t refund me because it has passed 48h. It is my fault that they have replied now???  I have contacted them just minutes after the incident. I feel like a donkey, and this is unacceptable. However I will contact police and even take them to court if necessary. I am so annoyed.

"The shopper was great. She kept in touch when items weren’t available. It was a great experience.  Then, I saw the charge and noticed that the promo my daughter-in-law had given me was not deducted from the balance, and I called their customer service, which was not easy to find a number in the first place. It just went downhill from there now I have about $200 worth of charges on two different credit cards that I had in my wallet and four out of six people that I’ve spoken to you were extremely rude.  I was hung up on twice trying to speak to the supervisor. I finally got one supervisor who I thought was great and he fixed everything. 10 days later I’m looking at those two credit cards and the charges are all back, including the credit he had given me and the charges were on a second credit card. I called back had a fairly difficult time getting a supervisor, but not as hard as the first time. Then I got a supervisor by the name of Gabriella, who talked like a robot and repeated the same thing over and over and was no help at all. She ended up hanging up on me.  I called back. Ask for another supervisor was told I’d be called back in an hour and if they were busy, never received a call two hours later I called back again and spoke to another representative. Asked to have a supervisor call me and was told it would be five minutes and they would call me. I never received a call back. I will never ever use Uber eats again or any of their services for that matter and neither will anybody I know because everybody will hear the story.

"We ordered food from a local restaurant because Uber eats offered a discount code on selected restaurants. We ordered at 7.25pm and the order said it would be here 8.05 but, as expected, it got pushed back to absolute latest at 8.30pm. It gets to 8.30 and no food. We then check the order which says ‘it’s been delivered 5/10 minutes ago. Check everywhere outside but no food. We call the restaurant who say it’s Ubereats problem yet there is no way of contacting Ubereats apart from a terrible customer services ‘chat’ which we had one response to and then silence. We had to quickly order from another restaurant if we were going to eat at all. I am over 7 months pregnant and get knackered in the evenings so to be eating at 10pm because of Ubereats and their shocking service is ridiculous. We were absolutely starving and it ruined what was meant to be a nice treat/evening. To have had no response on where the food ended up is what is most disappointing.

"Uber Eats is fine to use if you never expect to have problems with your orders---ever. However, the moment you have a problem with your order, you can expect no help from them. Trying to contact customer support is so difficult, I can only assume it was designed to be difficult. Once you reach customer support, their willingness to help you rivals the willingness of an insurance company required to pay out claims. They'll do anything to avoid actually helping you. Of course, this really isn't much different from any other food delivery service. Every order, you basically have to hope nothing goes wrong.

"What DREADFUL & AWFUL customer services this 'company' has!Ordered my food via mcdelivery which runs through uber eats - delivery driver/rider NEVER arrived at the given address, neither did she attempt to call me, instead she only text me...when I tried calling her and it went straight to voicemail...so I'm responding to her texts after she says she can't find the address...yet according to the delivery tracking map she was sat 2 minutes away on a completely different street!!I even went outside to look for her, she's nowhere to be seen, she then clicks a button that claims my food has been delivered instead of cancelling it...which would've automatically started the refund process...soI call uber eats customer services the first time, to seek some advice, the bloke told me to contact the McDonald's restaurant in question whom then told me to contact uber again so I did, explained the whole entire situation again and this time they were very very hostile...I was met with, ""Your delivery driver followed the guidelines and tried to contact you several times"" when I questioned how she tried to contact me the customer advisor couldn't confirm she tried to call me...and my phone call history will prove I never received a single attempted phonecall...only text messages :(And he refused to refund me the money I've lost which is in my opinion is absolutely awful.I sit here hungry & out of pocket because of a delivery drivers/riders navigational mess up.","Date of experience: October 12, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,MR,Trust Pilot,,
I received a promotion for 40% off 3 orders so I decided to use Uber eats instead of Door Dash.

"Complete and utter cluster. As an individual and as a family, we do meal delivery services on the regular. In fact, I work as a physician at a nearby hospital, small community, no more than 4,000 in the community and all restaurants within 5 minute of small community hospital. Never, not one single time, have we had any issue with either DoorDash or Grubhub or even delivery from independent local establishments.Working as a physician, along with all the night staff, I have crazy 12-hour shifts, typically 7p-7a. That means, upon arrival, myself and my nurses need to sort out meal plans early or the clock will beat us and we will run out of options. Thought I would give Uber Eats a try, for the sake of completeness and to give everyone a trial comparison.Big, big, HUGE mistake. Where to even begin. Place an order for the local Steak 'n Shake and execute the tracker so I can follow progress. It is about 8:15 pm at the time. Up comes the tracker and after only a very brief time shows my driver is at the restaurant picking up the order. This status remains unchanged for the better part of 30 minutes. Finally, as we push 45-60 minutes, the tracker reads ""Oops, finding another driver"". This is after 45-60 minutes and now we don't even have a driver?!After about 30 minutes of ""Oops"" persisting, the net result of this is very obvious, Uber doesn't have a driver available in this area, we are at one hour, clearly not going to make it before the ""absolute latest"" time, and my options are dwindling. Total time greater than one hour, ""Oops no driver"" time greater than 30 minutes. It was abundantly clear that the food was not going to be delivered in time, let alone probably not at all.I contact agents via the Uber Eats online chat and try to relate this and the urgency in resolving the issue so I can move on and still look at dining options for the night. All I got was a bunch of canned ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"" and reading from prepared scripts. I was still about 15 minutes out from the drop-dead time, but it was completely clear where we were headed for this and, if we get this resolved now, I can place another order with another delivery service, my only chance for eating anything other than a Crustable from the vending machine.Still...canned responses, scripts, etc. The suggestion was that ""the food is technically not late until 9:15 pm and it is already prepared, so we cannot refund unless it is after 9:15"". The thing is, it only would take about two minutes to realize that no delivery in > 1 hour and persistent ""Oops, finding another driver"" means that it just isn't going to happen, quite clearly at this point, so do me a favor and consider and a half to be late enough to give me time to still find something.Even the suggestion that a burger, fries, and shake made over an hour earlier would still be edible is pretty absurd. It is quite clear, Uber didn't have a driver anywhere near this small town and left me hanging for about an hour and a half while I was the only one apparently smart enough to figure that. When 9:15 did roll around, the status still read ""Oops, finding another driver"". No meal tonight, on the damned computer much of the first two hours of work, and the complete failure of customer service to make any effort to actually understand the problem and address the problem.Took me exactly two times to realize that Uber Eats either lacks the footprint or business plan to successfully practice this model. Among the most abysmal customer service experiences I have encountered for some time.","Date of experience: October 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Steve Perkins,Trust Pilot,,

"They do not believe in following FDA Food Safety Guidelines as outlined by United States Law. When my food has sat out for over 2 hours, they refuse a refund even though it is not food safe and could send a person to the hospital. If you want to have safe food, you have to pay a premium price. This should be illegal - you are charging customers extra should you ""not want Uber to break the law"" and send your family to the hospital with food poisoning. It is not the restaurants' fault - the fault lies solely with this negligent company. I am reporting them to the FDA and encourage everyone to do so. In case you've never worked in the Food Service Industry - any meat or dairy product that has sat out at temperatures over 40 degrees for over 1 hour is considered dangerous and not food safe. Food poisoning bacteria begin to grow on the food after this time and at these temperatures. They also lie and tell me that their drivers always use heating/warming bags, but never once in about 60+ orders has an UberEats driver used such a bag to keep the food hot. This website asked me for ""date of experience"" but this is a recurring problem and the Customer Service Agents refuse to address the illegalities of their practices or refund money for unsafe food. I have had multiple orders be picked up and driven around town for literally over 2 hours, to arrive ice cold and unsafe. Their answer is to ""show a photo"" then say it looks ""good"". That is not how Food Safety Inspections are done, by photo. The 'food safety clock' starts ticking the moment the potentially hazardous (if improperly handled) foods have left the refrigerator, not the store, as well. Every restaurant adheres to this or gets shut down when proper food regulations are in place. Uber doesn't care and they will NOT refund you in the case of food safety issues. When orders are wrong, the refunds are only for a portion of the missing items, as well. I had a missing order that never arrived a week ago - I did get a refund but they let the driver who kept my food keep the large tip I had left when placing the order, too. Never again. Call your local government about these practices and the FDA if you have also been wronged by this company. I am just glad that I have not gotten sick because I know when to toss it out, even if they just robbed me for $50 or more.","Date of experience: October 08, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,EL,Trust Pilot,,

I asked have u got my right address.. he say i will u back .he didn't.

"I have not ordered from UberEATS in a while but decided to try it out again after receiving a 50% off promotion. I went into the order with hesitation as I suspected that the amount of fees would largely, or completely, negate the provided discount, and I was correct. The 50% promotion was for a maximum value of $15, and this entire amount went to delivery and other fees.Again, this was almost expected. The reason I am giving my recent experience a 1-star review is because the delivery driver arrived more than 30-40 minutes later than the initial expected delivery time. In addition, the delivery driver's car that was displayed on the app was not the car that was actually driven to make the delivery. The restaurant also did not adhere to some of the special requests.

"First, a store appeared for delivery to my address, only at checkout to show it was too far away. More importantly, I was charged approximately double what I originally paid for all the items I did receive. I was told that the “estimated total” memorandum was supposed to account for discrepancies between price and store, when if you read the actual message in the app, it shows it’s for adjustments in weighted items and replacement items requested, nothing about major changes in prices being charged for exact items ordered. I have repeatedly asked the company for an itemized accounting of the cost paid per item, and have not received a response. From what I can calculate without an itemized list of what I actually paid, I was charged $90 for what I committed to paying $45 for in groceries. Another difficulty in calculating the exact difference was the fact the store was out of stock on 12 items ordered and still my total bill went from $80 up to $90 with me receiving 12 fewer items. Apparently, Uber Eats is just fine with bait and switching a low-income family for double the price on our already small grocery budget.

Been using this app for months, I would have done a fraud then if I wanted to. He did not deliver anything and kept on lying and yelling which showed me he was the guilty one. He dared to go to my family too, and all the support team agent did was to listen to him talking to me like that. Then he said to support that I was rude. Ofcourse I will be, who is gonna sit around and let people talk about their family when they are at fault. I even asked my neighbours in case it got misdelivered but nothing. Then Uber said they have a restriction on my account, for what? for asking my money back because I didnot get my order. We use this app alot and do hundreds of dollars of purchase but not anymore.

"Unfortunately I have to rate them one star — it’s been a while since I ordered there but they were there only once with the restaurant I like! When ordering I choose standard delivery and rather gave the driver a tip which was probably a mistake?! Essentially, it took over an hour to get my food (I could see on the app that the food was sitting at the restaurant for almost an hour before it was picked up). I tried contacting the driver who was just driving around and customer service how told me that it should be with me soon — what is even more frustrating is that you can see the driver in real time not picking up your order! When the driver finally picked up my order and even so he was already super late had to still make several stops on the way (again very frustrating because you thing you finally get your food only for him to drive one wrongs direction again). My food arrived 20 min after the latest estimated arrival and of course was melted/ cold so I complained again (a very long process unlike deliveroo, where you get a refund right away), they had to write and email and in the end I only go a particular refund even so my whole meal was ruined!So because I didn’t pay £3 extra for speedy delivery I had to wait over an hour got cold/ melted food and only got a partial refund— thank you but never again!

I asked to be put though to the complaints department but obviously no such thing exists, I will not be using uber eats again just because of my experience like I said, this is not the first time this happened also on top of all this hassle, on a separate occasion  I had a uber eats driver ringing me tell me to confirm delivery before I received it because he only had half of my order and didn't have the decency to deliver what he had on him, the driver asked me to mark this as delivered and then claim, then was never refunded for what I was missing.

"It used to be 4-5 stars. I've been with them since the beginning. They have increasingly gotten worse. Their time estimates are basically bait and switch. They'll give a short estimate to encourage you to order. Then in tiny subscript there will be a second ""delivered latest by"" time after you put the order in that puts a second estimate 20-40 min after your initial time estimate range. Now every 3rd order, I'm getting deliveries that actually deliver 20-30 min past this ""latest by"" time, getting close to 2 hrs sometimes. Then to add insult to injury, they put your account on review if you complain too much, because their broken system encourages inaccurate delivery estimates, and regularly breaks them. Basically they bait and switch you to order, then deliver in 2-3x the time estimate and give a pittance for compensation.

Worst company policy.My food delayed by 1 hour and I had to throw the cold kebab that came dry with non edible onion rings. Paid £25 for something I could have bought at £15. Cannot contact Uber as there is no way to reach them . You have to leave a message on the app. They messaged . Me next day with £7.10 refunded and sorry. I had to throw the whole pack as didn't risk getting food poisoning but looks like Uber is asking me to take a risk and eat it and take the £7.10 they offered. When questioned they said that's all they can do. Pls. Go for just eat. They are much faster when you have a problem.

Custome service is horrible. You see getting replies from bots that send the same repetitive message. Clearly my message wasn't even being read. Uber make out the issues resolved by using bots with the broken record technique. Meanwhile I'm still owed a refund. I've uploaded photos 3 times and sent 2 lengthy messages explaining how the order and bill don't tally. They're not bothered about customers. That's v clear! It's taken 2 days now to resolve a very straightforward issue. I'm still waiting for satisfactory resolution. This is time of my life I'll never get back. I'm deleting the app after this.

"I recently ordered the Green Thai Curry with rice and I must say, it was an absolute delight! From the portion size to the flavor profile, everything was on point.First and foremost, the portion size was incredibly generous, making it perfect for two people. It was more than enough to satisfy our appetites and even left us with some leftovers for later. Value for money? Absolutely!The Green Thai Curry itself was a burst of flavors. It had the perfect balance of creamy coconut goodness and just the right amount of heat. Each bite was a harmonious blend of aromatic spices and fresh ingredients that danced on my taste buds. I appreciate a good Thai curry, and this one exceeded my expectations.What made this experience even more special was the handwritten note that accompanied my meal. It's those personal touches that set this business apart. It brightened my day and showed genuine care for their customers.Kudos to the team for creating such a delightful culinary experience. This is a hidden gem that deserves all the recognition it can get. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Thank you for making my day, and I look forward to my next order!","Date of experience: September 30, 2023",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,MS,Trust Pilot,,

So I lost my money 70 pounds and the driver ended up with the food for free ?????? now saying the supermarket doesn’t accept returns, it makes you wonder why the driver is so keen to say no one was home so they can get the food for free, because the supermarket won’t accept food back because of non delivery This company won’t say what happens to the food (that supposedly was undeliverable ?

"We ordered grocery from Waitrose on 25 September (20EAD was the order number) and waited over an hour for the delivery to arrive. Whilst checking the delivery person through Uber Eats app, we saw that he stopped nearby our house and marked the order as ""delivered"". We were waiting for him door open but noone came. We immediately tried to call him but he didn't pick up. I also tried calling him from my mobile as well for more than 20 times and he didn't reply. After explaining the situation to Uber Eats, they wrote back saying that the delivery person was outside our house for more than 7 minutes, hence we were not eligible for a refund. In total, we waited more than 1 hour for the delivery which was not delivered at all.This makes no sense as the Uber Eats app asks for a code which we need to provide to the delivery person. And how come the delivery can be marked as ""delivered"" without obtaining the code from us. And it is not acceptable for Uber Eats to believe the delivery person without any proof of delivery.Very disappointing experience with Uber Eats. Such a shame.The next day we went to local Waitrose store to explain and they agreed to give us the fruit and vegetables from our order for free(excluding a milk, yogurt and bread, which is also weird).","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AD,Trust Pilot,,

I wouldn’t even feed my dog this crap. All the food was cold and dry, completely ruined my evening and I was at work doing a 12 hour shift. Tried to use the uber eats app, and it’s bloody useless. Can’t get past their stupid automated options and it wouldn’t even let me use a chat box to speak to an employee! You can’t bloody win! Tried calling them next and guess what? Bloody automated system again! Apparently, they don’t deal with ‘past order issues’ which is ridiculous because how am I supposed to know if my order has an issue before I get it? Dumb logic. And the delivery was delayed by another 20 minutes. Next morning, I called Uber rides and asked them to transfer me to Uber eats customer service. Lady named Hagar was unhelpful, didn’t bother to understand, wouldn’t even let me finish speaking before saying she couldn’t help me over the phone and that she would send a message in the app. I uploaded pictures an told her the issue in the app, and she then tells me she can’t process a refund and they ‘understand’ this is not the outcome I wanted.

He called twice but he wasn't engaged in the call as I later on found out that they need to make two calls to follow the policy so he won't be blamed. However, he was planning on not delivering the food as he wasn't listening to instructions for the address. Looking at the map he was in the same location not trying to find our address and waiting for the time to finish so he can take the food. We never received our food eventually and felt so gutted. Lots of phone calls to uber customer service however no outcome. On the other hand, McDonald's were very helpful and gave us vouchers as a courtesy.","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SA,Trust Pilot,,

Shocking Treatment - I placed an order for lunch via the McDonalds app. I tracked the delivery and was outside waiting for it and then suddenly the app reported my food had been delivered. So with no food and £13 down I called the local McDonalds in St Neots Cambridgeshire and reported the situation. they were not interested and told me to talk to Uber Eats. I called the McDonalds head office in Finchley again they were not interested. So I called Uber Eats and they said nothing they can do its been delivered.

In English I could not understand I was snapped at on arrival when I asked the young lady a question. She later went on to over charge me as she had the wrong order which I can accept but there was no apology. When will someone like that realize I am parting with my hard-earned money in difficult times, have choices where I spend my money and feel that as a customer I should be respected.

We told them to jog on, now they want businesses to pay to sell and pay them a 30% cut. Clearest sign they're a failing business with no business sense. I made it clear I didn't want any additional tablets because we use a software integration to manage multiple orders on one platform but they didn't care. £520 ""joining fee"" or nothing.

This was our family birthday meal that was cancelled by Uber not by me. In none of the messages was the ‘cancel order’ option selected. The order was placed a second time to avoid the family meal being ruined and left us hugely out of pocket.

To celebrate my husband’s 60th I decided to order a takeaway from a nice restaurant. This was for 9 people so the cost was £250. I ordered a few days in advance to give plenty of notice and so that I could amend as we got closer to the date. The food when delivered was missing item’s amounting to £25. When I complained to Uber the next day I was advised that because my original order was made more than 48 hours in advance I would not receive a refund. This means that I would needed to know that items would be missing BEFORE I received my order. It’s a scam to stop you from being reimbursed fairly. Appalling service.

"I recently used Uber Eats in the UK, and here's my honest review. While it's known for its speed, there's a catch – you have to pay an additional fee to get your delivery first. It's quick, but only if you're willing to cough up more money.On a personal note, I've been using Uber Eats since it first launched in the UK, and I've noticed some significant changes. Unfortunately, most of these changes have made it less appealing. The platform now charges restaurants over 30% of their sales, which likely leads to an increase in menu prices. On top of that, there are additional fees for delivery, and if you want your food to arrive faster, you guessed it – another fee.The ""discounts"" they offer are often limited to certain struggling restaurants, which doesn't really benefit the average customer. Due to all these fees and increased food prices, I've made the decision to stop using Uber Eats. It's simply become too expensive for what it offers.My advice? Consider alternatives or grab something on your way home – it's usually cheaper, more convenient, and fresher.","Date of experience: September 25, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,RE,Trust Pilot,,

"Horrible customer service. I had a driver who refused to come at the main entrance of my building and call the bell, he texted me in the app he has arrived and demanded me to come out and get the food. When is I told him I couldn’t come out he left and took the food with him. That’s not the main problem though, the problem is the horrible customer service which is also hard to reach. I texted them the situation and they said the driver was waiting already 7 minutes. Then I asked them why he didn’t follow the instructions already setup as a previous driver. They told me a million times he couldn’t  reach me and I explained to them a million times he did through the app and I did reply. I asked him to come to the building entrance and he declined and they continued telling me that my order is not eligible for refund because he was waiting 7 minutes. Like no solid reasoning and response to the actual facts whatsoever. I ended up being more pissed off at the customer experience rather than the driver. They could have just justified the driver, he could  have even been in a bad day, cool, but what do you do though as a customer service? You respond like an intelligent human at least according to what the customer is saying and resolve the issue in a way instead of repeating a script gaslighting the customer because you didn’t bother to read what was reported. Like never again. App deleted. I won’t be hungry because of that Uber. At the end of the day, Uber is not an essential service.I would suggest others to follow the same.

Initial response took 7 hours and didn't answer the questions. 2nd response an additional 4 hours still not answering any of the queries.

However after a while they started doing multi drops and I ended up getting my meals cold. But, the worse was to come the drivers started just not delivering at all. On one occasion the driver came to my door and then just drove away I took picture of his number plate on his moped for proof, then on the last occastion the delivery the driver simply delivered it to the wrong adress in wrong area. When i called to tell him he said he would contact uber to get my refund but I dought he did. I called CS at uber-eats on two occastions to report non deliverys and they say the money takes 10 days to go back into my bank - Been 30 days, so far no money has been returned now I am down 50 pounds with nothing to show for it.

"Terrible Experience: Never Using Uber Eats Again!Order Number: #3C953Order Date: 23/07/2023I had an absolutely horrendous experience with Uber Eats, and I feel compelled to share my frustration and disappointment. I placed an order worth £28.18 on the aforementioned date, and to my utter disbelief, the meal was never delivered. It was a complete letdown, and I'm still in disbelief that such a reputable service could fail so miserably.Upon realizing that my order was missing, I immediately contacted Uber Eats to report the issue and request a refund. Little did I know that this would be the start of a long and frustrating journey. Despite raising a formal complaint and providing all the necessary details, my money was never refunded as requested. It's incredibly disheartening to be left out of pocket after a service failure that was entirely out of my control.To add insult to injury, the food was delivered to a completely different address than my own. Not only did Uber Eats fail to deliver the meal I paid for, but they also managed to deliver it to the wrong location entirely. This level of incompetence is beyond comprehension, especially considering that accurate address information was provided during the ordering process.The most disappointing aspect of this entire ordeal has been Uber Eats' abysmal customer service. Their complaint service is an absolute joke. It's truly disheartening to see a company with such potential fall so short in terms of addressing customer issues. My attempts to communicate with their support team were met with indifference, delays, and ultimately, no resolution.After this appalling experience, I can confidently say that I will never use Uber Eats again. The poor service, coupled with the complete lack of accountability and support, has left me feeling frustrated, cheated, and deeply dissatisfied. I urge anyone considering using Uber Eats to think twice and explore alternative food delivery services that prioritize their customers' satisfaction and take responsibility for their failures.In conclusion, my experience with Uber Eats has been nothing short of a nightmare. From the undelivered meal to the incorrect delivery address and their woeful complaint service, every aspect of their service has been a disappointing failure. Save yourself the trouble and avoid Uber Eats at all costs.","Date of experience: July 23, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ropafadzo Mshayavanhu,Trust Pilot,,

"(Added to McDonalds as well.)McDonalds have “partnered” with Uber Eats to deliver food.

Uber refused to refund, as the order was “delivered within their given time” i.e before the last possible minute that gave.Went through to McDonalds via Facebook, and was given a £10 voucher. Not the full cost, but I accepted it.Ordered again today, stupidly. Turned up even colder than yesterday which I didn’t think possible. Uber again refused the refund. McDonalds have also refused a refund or to acknowledge fault. They don’t have access to Ubereats’s transactions.I have reached out to CAB over this. It may seem like a small amount to get upset about, but the point is that two days in a row I have been forced to bin all the food, as no means to reheat, and will not be compensated with my money back.

"Do NOT use Ubereats unless you have an entire evening to throw away being frustrated and hungry. They’ll reschedule your delivery numerous times, they won’t allow you to cancel it when that happens so you can’t make a new order, but they’ll allow a driver to cancel it after you’ve spent 2.5 hours of waiting. Original delivery time of 8:10. At 8:00, that changed to 9:20pm. The original LATEST delivery estimate was 8:55, and every customer service agent refused to look into the matter until that time and I was essentially told to get lost until then. All while the app says it won’t be arriving until 9:20 anyway. Then I noticed the driver was reassigned a second time. At 9pm, I tried to reach out to customer service, where my order was suddenly cancelled without any input from me. They said somebody else had picked up the order. I’m absolutely sure it was one of the other drivers who picked it up and then disappeared off the map. They’ll let a driver pick something up, then they’ll reassign the order (!!!???), and no communication will happen between the two drivers or the restaurant about who picked up the food and where it went. I was willing to wait 2 hours for cold soggy food but that was the final straw. Because they cancelled and refunded the order, I was again essentially told to get lost by customer service. Not one person considered this situation to be a real problem or an inconvenience. They don’t give a SPLIT sh!t about the customer experience. This service takes orders they KNOW they can’t fulfil all in an attempt to grab as much money as they can.

"Unbelievably bad.  Every 5 mins the estimated delivery went back.  15 mins turned into 1 hour 25 mins.  The “no later than” time was exceeded by 20 minutes.  And, predictably, the food was stone cold and items were missing!The app is scandalous- no option to cancel, no option to complain, receipt takes 24 hours etc.  when I tried to message a delivery person my message disappeared as I was typing - twice!!  A classic case of “make it as difficult as possible”.  I then messaged to say that items were missing and the response I get was, “thank you for your feedback!”  No less than a 100% refund plus a credit would be in order here, but it will probably take a fight to get that.  So Uber Eats relies on drunk people who can’t be bothered to complain and technology designed to frustrate.  What a great business model!  Please take your business elsewhere and show this terrible business that their lack of integrity will cost them in the end.","Date of experience: September 21, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,David Little,Trust Pilot,,

Wouldn't even give it one star!!! DISGUSTING SERVICE Ordered thru Mcdonalds app. The driver accepted the order 15 minutes before they decided to actually go to the restaurant. They decided to just sit there (they where a mile away from restaurant) and when they decided to move they took forever to get there and I'm guess by the time they got there the food was freezing!Took 4 minutes for them to drive from the restaurant to my house. So I highly doubt the food turned stone cold in 4 minutes. After they delivered the food the driver purposely left the delivery open as if to say it was still being delivered so it looked like he delivered it within the time frame. WHICH HE DID NOT. I contacted uber for help through the mcdonalds app and twitter and did not want to give the refund (the order was £30) and kept saying to call customer service when we did and they told us to call mcdonalds to get a refund which they knew we couldn't!!

Ordered a Mac delivery. Given an approx time for delivery and then a more accurate time. We waited at door for 5 minutes after delivery time check app which stated driver had tried to contact me. I checked to see as I had had my phone with me snd no calls had been made so I tried to contact driver and I wasn’t able to be connected. I then saw it said it had been delivered but it hadn’t been. I tried the Uber help number who told me it was down to Macdonalds to refund as their driver tried to contact. I told them I could prove he hadn’t tried to contact me but they said unable to do do refund. I contacted macdonalds who told me contact them again which I did with same result. I contacted Macdonalds customer service explained again and said it was definitely Uber thst should sort this out but would highlight this problem. In short I contacted a manager at Uber who again refused to acknowledge the problem was with their driver snd would not refund my money.

"I ordered foods from the same restaurants that I used for many years through Uber eats this evening. The delivery was late by 30 minutes than what the app said initially, then the Uber driver showed up at my door only to say he didn't have my food. He was on the phone with a rep for 15 minutes while I was standing by him waiting for my concern to be resolved. The driver reassured me that he will go back and bring my food in 10 minutes, then rep said that he can leave and deliver the other orders as my order will be delivered by someone else. The delivery guy reassured me my food will be delivered in 20 minutes, then left. Shortly after, I received a notification that my order has been canceled, and will be reimbursed (excluding the tip). I called the customer service and only thing they could do is to cancel the order and refund. I escalated to their supervisor only to be told that they can't compensate me for 2 hours that I've wasted because they didn't know how to do their job properly and because I am not subscribed customer.

What’s the purpose of putting delivery instructions in your profile if they are not going to respect them. I clearly have please meet me at the door and hand me the food.  In addition to my food I ordered an orange Fanta as well.  Well the app said the driver is 1 min away. Well it said that for 5 mins.  I just happen to go to the door to look out to see if they were out there and I saw my food sitting on the ground with ants around the bag.  And the orange Fanta was clear…go figure.  So I picked everything up and came in the house. The beve to waste on my hand and it tasted like seltzer water.  The only thing I could eat was the wings because they were in a covered box everything else was in the little open boat containers and I don’t know if anything crawled in them.  I tried calling the driver and it went to voicemail. So I contacted customer service through chat.  They gave me a 4-5 paragraph apology and a $2 credit.  Well the beverage it’s self was $3.39.  So I texted back and inquired what was the $2 for when the beverage was $3.39 their response was we’ve credited your account with $2 is anything else we can help you with.  So needless to say I will go back to DOORDASH!!!   I will not be using Uber Eats again.

I receive a call where the driver was talking to me but I could not understand anything (unfortunately he had a thick accent and his english wasn't very good - not the driver's fault but made communication difficult). Therefore I told him to switch to chat, where I typed instructions as to how to reach my office, even giving the store in front as reference. No reply. Tried to call the driver. No reply.

May I take an additional 2 minutes to review your account?they said they wouldn't fill the order because now at 4:10 am when my order was supposed to reach me at 4:20 am the driver called while still at the restaurant and I heard the staff say they wouldn't fill the order and i needed to contact uber for a refund not them. but I could reorder breakfast if I like and I said wju would I want double the amount of money out of my account becasue the wouldn't fill my order as i ordered ityes please call ahmed the driver he will confirmThank you for waiting patiently.Vinessa, sorry for the inconvenience we are not able to contact the delivery person.Vinessa, what I understand so far is that you didn't receive the order however you have been charged, right?I shouldn't be charged at all for the 28.11 for inconvenience of driver and restaurant when it was them that didn't want to fill my orderyes it is out of my accountalmost 35 dollarsand I wasn't going to order more food to take more money out of my account and not this money back in it yetI can absolutely understand your point of view.Cancellation Fee $28.11September 19, 2023not right cause the restaurant is actually inconveniencing me and my family now so do I get to have you charge them the 28.11 and give it to me on top of my total order that I never gotVinessa, I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused by your recent purchase.I realize that this situation is difficult, I would feel frustrated too in that situation since I am also a customer like you and expect value for money.Vinessa, thank you for sharing your insights with us. It’s hard for us to hear that you didn’t have a very good experience, we always try to provide our customers with the best support possible.Vinessa, we are unable to provide you with a price adjustment for this order as the order was canceled at your end after the merchant accepted the order and before the maximum time of delivery. In the future, make sure your order is accurate before submitting it. If the store or delivery person asks you to cancel the order anytime in the future, you can ask them to reach out using in-app support to make sure you aren’t charged.the mrechant refused the order and I will take this to bbb and all review places online until you return my money to meI did ask them to reach out to you and again no help or customer service at all","Date of experience: September 19, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,VW,Trust Pilot,,

"Appalling customer service. Driver decides to go somewhere convenient that is no where near where I live. Starts a seven minute timer and proceeds to ignore me when I explain that he is not where I live or anywhere near it. Driver ignores messages and phone calls and abandons food in some poor persons flower pot (I'm so sorry whoever's door this was). Get in touch with customer service who refuse to accept fault. They won't refund and won't tell me why. Days of messaging and they tell me that I have messaged them too much, I have had good many issues previously and they will not do anything regarding this situation. This was the first time I had ever gotten in touch regarding an order so that is utter rubbish. They are very rude and accusatory. There is no official complaints system as the only way to complain is through the same chat service. If you want to complain about a driver, service, customer service, it all goes through the same people who you just have to trust that they will take your complaint seriously even after they've made you feel awful about yourself.

When I asked him what took so long he claimed that there was a technical issue on McDonalds part and the food was freshly made.

I open my door to find no one there. I tell him he’s gone to the wrong address at which point he starts yelling at me. He eventually drives round and I signal to him. Tells me to come downstairs and collect the order. I tell him I paid for the order to be delivered to my door. He refuses and says he went to a door, which wasn’t my even mine! He eventually just dumped my order at the bottom of my estate because he couldn’t follow instructions to deliver to my door as I had paid for. I started a chat on the app with someone who was just as rude and unprofessional, cut my chat and didn’t resolve my issue. Refused to refund the order, even though it had been dumped somewhere.

"This is easily the worst app to use when you need your food to get to you in time and they’re quite consistent at it. Food basically stays ready at the restaurant waiting on driver which can run into hours. App would appear to show a driver is assigned whereas that’s just a placeholder and the actual driver who’ll get the food (whoever that is) has not been assigned or engaged yet. The only decent thing about the app is easy navigation but for actual efficiency of delivery, the worst. What’s even worse is you call customer care and they can’t offer you any support besides telling you to keep waiting. Oh like I haven’t been doing that already before calling?I do not recommend, I’ll be switching to other deliver services asap","Date of experience: September 15, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JD,Trust Pilot,,

"I believe even one star is too much for 40 min delay to an order (which never arrived but was charged for) since the time driver picked order up. Driver calling every five minutes amidst busy work day to say that bike is broken but refusing to cancel order which is cold by then! Driver passing on the address to have order delivered by someone not working for Uber and not agreed by us. Ultimately, after repeat requests to cancel and being distracted from work by all this mess we cancelled and the cost of not received order was not returned to us! Interaction with so called customer service (which is (or behaves like) a bot deserves a separate post).

My main concern was my son can’t have cocoa and would have had to be taken to hospital if he drank it. Lucky I always check the food before giving it to him.

I was also told one would call me later in the evening.  They didn’t.  What an absolute scam.Lately, the delivery time changes several times.  And then you get a message that your order is on the way, but the driver has a few stops.  Translation: your food will be so cold you may as well have eaten out of the garbage.  Such a shame.

"I placed an order worth €50, adding to the over 20 orders I've made throughout this year, on my Uber Eats account created in Nov 2017 (as soon as it opened in Lisbon).I can count on one hand the number of times I've spoken to support due to minor issues, such as incorrect or missing items. Every time, the support team was extremely attentive and resolved the problem.On this order dated 4th of September, one of the products was Salmon Tartare. The product description reads: ""Shari, Salmon, and avocado cream"", and the image clearly shows a generous layer of avocado cream covering the Tartare.Unfortunately, to my astonishment when I received the tartare, it only contained two ingredients, rice and salmon.I immediately contacted support to report the issue, expecting they would offer a fair compensation, as they always had the few times I experienced similar problems.To my surprise, Uber Eats' support this time dismissed any responsibility, stating that ""merchants might not include condiments if they are not listed on the menu."" When I replied that it wasn't a condiment, but a missing ingredient, and that it was clearly not only in the image but in the description, they responded that ""Although we know this wasn't the experience you were expecting, unfortunately, we can't issue a refund.""Following this unfortunate reply, on 5/09, I asked to speak with a supervisor and have since been ignored. Attached, I'm sending the photo of the product from the shop vs. what I received, as well as the exchanged messages. To conclude, I'd like to mention that the cost of the Tartare is €6.50, in an order of €49.39, which makes this whole sad situation even more ridiculous.","Date of experience: September 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,João Ricardo Silva,Trust Pilot,,

"For a few months, I had a monthly membership that was $9.99/m. Out of no where, I was charged $60 for an annual membership(this was in July 2023). I never changed or canceled my monthly membership, nor authorized to be charged for the annual membership. I chocked it up to a glitch, contacted customer service, and they refunded me. I continued my monthly membership for 9.99 for a month, then decided to cancel it all together, because I wasn't using it enough to justify paying for it. Woke up today to a 14.99 charge from UberOne on my bank account. [Follow along, because this get confusing]. Contacted customer service, asked for a cancellation and refund. I was told because I had already been refunded in the past(that annual membership I never signed up for), that they wouldn't refund me. So I asked why it was 14.99 instead of the monthly 9.99, he told me it was for a 3-month membership and I was ""only charged 14.99 instead of the standard 30 for three months"" as if I should be appreciative. He then explained it as ""You canceled the annual membership, but kept your monthly membership, so you were charged for a 3 month membership."" EXPLAIN to me how that makes sense. I never should have been charged for the annual. I shouldn't have been charged for the 3 months, after canceling it all together. And I shouldn't have been charged for 3 months PERIOD because I never signed up for it. He and I went around in circles for 15 minutes then he hung up the chat.

"Just awful. There is no level of customer service with Uber at all. Their automated management of delivery can easily be hacked by lazy drivers and then Uber refuses to give you any compensation. Recently had a driver call up, rude, “where’s your house”, like the guy doesn’t have sat nav and I haven’t given exact instructions. Hangs up on me, connection is awful. Then says he’s at my house waiting on the app - “delivered, waiting” in Ubers eyes, but actually you can see him still cycling around the neighbourhood on the app. Then I am connected to the driver x3 and he hangs up on me. They will have data that shows that the driver was not at the property and cycling around randomly, and they have data that shows I tried to call him x3. But they only care about the wait time data, which is easily hacked by bad drivers. There is no cx, you can’t talk to anyone. They always side with the awful drivers they have too. Never using again.

"I placed an order and the driver picked up the wrong food. The restaurant called me to let me know. I reached out to the driver with no luck so left him a message. I immediately reached out to ubereats to ask them to get in touch with the driver and get him to turn around. They outright refused to and said the order has to complete. I complained and said that’s a waste of food, time and fuel. They can call him and stop this. They still refused. They said they won’t help me until the order completed then cut the chat. I reached out again. The new rep said he was looking into it. The driver decided not to cancel the order but waited for it to automatically complete. The moment this happened, the Uber rep said they can’t help because the order is live. Completely different to what the previous rep said. Then he cut that chat. I reached out for help to say my order was not delivered. They said it was and I won’t be assisted. That I would be emailed. I’m waiting for my dinner! I need immediate conversation not an email. So I called the restaurant and told them I will place a single item order so they get another driver. Uber then gave me a massive charge for a small order. I then used this opportunity to reach out again to chat to explain what was happening and to raise a complaint. I provided screenshot evidence.

"Refusal to refund a food safety issue September 9th, 2023Today I ordered blueberries and raspberries as well as some frozen items from Target using Uber eats. When I went to wash the raspberries there was some mold outside but mold inside most of the raspberries. I took a picture and asked customer service to either refund the money or call Target so that I could pick up some good raspberries this week. They refused both and said there was nothing they could do. So use Uber eats to shop or dine in at your own risk. Yesterday when I ordered the same two items I did not get either of them so some of their shoppers need training. Before that, a shopper brought me tuna in a paper pack instead of chicken in a can. This is in spite of having photos of the items they are shopping for. Uber eats repeatedly asked me to give the shopper today a bad rating but that would not be fair to him as the mold may not have been something he would know to look for. Now this is interesting as Uber eats has no problem asking the customer to poorly rate the shopper when that person needs to make a living. Target would reimburse Uber eats for bad product but Uber eats does not consider it worth their time and would rather have food safety issues they refuse to address and poor customer relations.

Then assigned another driver, who delivered the food at 10.20pm however it was the complete wrong order for less than half of what was paid for. We complained to Ubereats, sent a photo of the order we received, but was told that because it was delivered we aren't entitled to any refund.

An example: I made a pre-order 4 days prior for a work lunch to be delivered. On the date of delivery, it hadn’t arrived. When I raised it, Uber Eats said that they couldn’t do anything about it or issue a refund because I had made a pre-order outside of their timeline to look at these matters. Basically, I would have had to pre-empt that my order wasn’t going to be delivered and notify them in advance of delivery that it wasn’t going to be delivered. Anytime there is an issue, they bring up their illogical “policy” - I’ve deleted the app. It’s not worth the hassle when there are other delivery apps available.","Date of experience: May 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SA,Trust Pilot,,

"Uber Eats has terrible customer service. If your driver brings you the wrong or missing item, and it happens frequently, they will more often times than not refuse to give you a refund. It is illegal to charge for a product that you didn't get. They can improve through hiring better employees by giving them better income, so the mistakes are unlikely to happen. They can also refund you when your order is wrong. Perhaps, they should implement a system where the restaurant is required to submit a photo of the order, so it's obvious if the order was wrong or something was missing. It may not be a perfect system as it relies on driver honesty and puts in an extra step for busy restaurants, but if they're not going to trust the customer when they say they didn't get something, it's the least they can do.","Date of experience: September 06, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JE,Trust Pilot,,

"In Uber Eats, you only have 3-5 seconds to cancel your order and not pay a cancellation fee. This is very ridiculous! How come such a big company didn't think of this?!!!! At least after the final registration of the order, an opportunity of 1-2 minutes should be given so that if there is a mistake in the order, the order can be canceled without cancellation fee. It means that when the order is registered and the restaurant confirms it, the restaurant will start preparing after 2 minutes. It is very strange that as soon as the restaurant accepts the order, it is written in the software that the restaurant is in the middle of preparation, and from then on there is no turning back!! If anyone wants to cancel their order at this point, they will have to waive all the money they paid for the food, because it will all be charged for the cancellation fee, and that's too bad!!!! A few days ago I paid more than 170 dollars for the cancellation fee, I canceled my order in exactly less than a minute, but because three seconds after placing the order, it was written that the restaurant is preparing!! And when I talked to them, they only replied that the restaurant had prepared your food!!! How is it possible ?!! We all know that in restaurants, food preparation starts more than 5 minutes after placing the order!!! This is a scam!!! It is better to change the rules, I will not use Uber from now on.","Date of experience: August 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,H.,Trust Pilot,,

Our order time kept getting delayed and went beyond the ""maximum delivery time."" The actual restaurant itself was a fast food place with a drive thru that 10 min from us, so I think that the platform just had trouble finding a driver. The food was cold by the time it got to us.

Uber eats is a wonderful platform that has grown a lot but it still has a little ways to go. This was the first meal in about five meals that I've ordered off of Uber eats that was actually pleased with everything I bought. I wish that I could say that about all the items I've ever bought on Uber eats with the truth is a lot of things just don't deliver correctly or well. Also some of them have just been something I can simply make it home / very unimpressive. Like The Rice bowl company I ordered food from it felt very basic and dry and I was not pleased. This last company the Thai food restaurant was amazing and I would order online from them multiple times. But I wouldn't know unless I ordered from them before. That's the problem with Uber eats it is a wonderful platform to get things delivered I wish sometimes they would do restaurants further away and just make you pay a small fee because there are some restaurants that are far away that I can't access but I was still pay for knowing that the food would be like colder and I wouldn't care less if it was from my very favorite place. But I digress. This platform is wonderful I even got free delivery for the first time and I don't know how long. But it did help with making the choice of whether or not I was going to actually order delivery. Because sometimes the fees and everything after it all adds up plus tax just makes me say all right I'm going to make bowl of ramen. I will say that I checked my email and I had several emails that I let expire for multiple Uber eats deals. So if you're a person who doesn't mind the emails when you do want to use them they do have plenty of promotional codes offers and everything else. That I will give them an A+ on. I wonder if they do tests on the restaurant as far as does it deliver well within the radius that it says it can.,"Date of experience: September 01, 2023",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,SW,Trust Pilot,,

"Last times we ordered with UberEats we had problems with the orders and UberEats didn't take charge. It's impossible to reach them, and they don't answer the messages and after one week when they do they just say to contact the restaurant, and that's it. They provide a service, they take a cut and they don't help the customers.

Worst experience and waste of money. I was unwell and ordered food with Ubereats. I used it because I had a voucher for delivery which wouldn’t apply unless I had it delivered so I thought great I’m ill. I paid £16 with a £5 discount. The food left the store at 8:40 and I received just after 9:30. The driver was driving around and around and spoke little english. When I went outside to collect my food in my pjs he had my food in his hand with no insulated bag and was just stood there. He had logged on his side he was at the delivery but he wasn’t even at my address. Once I had walked the few mins Back my food was freezing cold I contacted Uber who said they are sorry my food wasn’t at the temperature I wanted and thank you for the feedback. I will never in my life use this service again,"Date of experience: September 02, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CU,Trust Pilot,,

"Ordering fast food from Uber eats while I'm sick in bed with covid went fine so I thought I'd try grocery delivery, since i can't go anywhere myself. Big mistake. They overcharged me by over $50 and several items were missing. Customer service insisted that the shopper tried to contact me with changes - a total lie. I had my phone in my hand the whole time (what else do you do when you have covid?). They actually made me take a picture of the cheese they brought (it was the wrong cheese and cost 3x more than what was ordered). Then the part where it allows you to rate your order was suspiciously unavailable, meaning I couldn't even claw back any of the overly generous tip I'd given. They did promise a partial refund ($28) but my experience is ruined and I just feel sicker now from the stress of it.","Date of experience: September 02, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bobbii,Trust Pilot,,

Order online at approx 6:20pm & advised delivery approx 7pm. Driver phoned with very thick accent & all I could make out was he was asking for password which was provided. As this was my first order I assumed he needed it to collect my order. At 7:45 I phoned restaurant to be advised order collected quite a while ago. Couldn’t work out how to contact driver or Uber. At 8:15pm found my order at my front door. It must have been there in the cold for 60mins. Order was cold & now soggy. Driver didn’t ring the door bell. He just dropped the order at the door.  Told by my adult daughter later that driver phones on arrival but as I couldn’t understand what he was saying when he phoned. Poor communication.  Very unhappy with lack of customer service.

"Title: Disappointing Experience with Uber EatsRating: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5)I've been a loyal user of the Uber Eats app for a while now, but my recent experience left me extremely disappointed. I ordered food and eagerly awaited its arrival, only to receive it ice-cold.I immediately contacted customer support, hoping for a quick resolution, but to my dismay, my request for a refund was denied. This is unacceptable. As a customer, I expect my food to arrive in the right condition, and when it doesn't, I should have the confidence that the issue will be promptly resolved.The lack of support and refusal to refund for a cold meal has left a sour taste in my mouth. It's disheartening to see such a decline in the quality of service from a platform I used to rely on.I hope Uber Eats takes this feedback seriously and works on improving its customer service and quality control.

Avoid ordering with uber eats at all costs, use their competitors instead, some may charge more but at least they don’t steal your money when they cause an issue.

"So we ordered from a local Thai place last night using Uber eats. After almost two hours we were starving and wondering where the food has got to. We had a notification to say that the food has b en delivered to another house so we went out looking for it. Then when looking into it ubereats claimed they had tried to deliver and had waited at our address for 7 minutes. I was by the door all evening and noone tried to deliver anything. Next they said that they did not have our address, just a postcode yet because they had attempted delivery we are not entitled to a refund. Absolute rubbish, thieving company with a shocking customer service just copy and pasting something basically saying do one your not having your money back. So no food and no money.

"I’ve had too many bad experiences with them at this point so this time, I’m done with them. Customer service is a joke and I’m really fed up with their arrogance. I’m supposed to get $120 back from superbowl Sunday because the restaurant canceled, they didn’t have any of those foods and didn’t know why that menu was even up, i got the money back from my bank, but then my bank reversed the charges due to Uber eats writing an email to them that I didn’t cancel in a timely manner and had enough time to change my order, myself and the manager of the restaurant called uber eats and burnt we were getting somewhere with them. Nope! So I never got my money back, I honestly don’t know why I still used them after that but today was the last time. I ordered breakfast from McDonald’s and this location does suck, because they always leave things out of the order. This time was no different from the other times. If there were other McDonald’s locations to choose from at that time, then I would have. I basically have long Covid so almost everything smells and tastes rotten to me. One of the only things that I can eat is the egg and cheese McGriddle. I basically have no choice sometimes, especially since I do not drive. They forgot something in the order for my son and also filled up his drink only halfway. That’s unacceptable. I went back and forth with Uber eats customer service and nothing got resolved. I think the workers feel like they are too above everyone else and are untouchable. The company itself is not good at all. No supervisor ever called me back no matter how many times that I called.

Multiple attempts to message via the app, was told that I would be transferred to the 'relevant department'. Was never transferred, chat was disconnected. Finally got through to the 'relevant department' in the chat and received automated messages that were not resolving the issue.

"Uber delivery service was excellent.  The idiot restaurant missed 3 fries and got 2 hamburgers wrong.  I let Uber know and was given 5 in credit.  I have again asked for this to be resolved and waiting. The credit doesn’t cover cost of 3 fries, also and most importantly, it does not give me the food I did not get.  The response I wanted was ‘we will discuss with the restaurant, get your fries and correct hamburgers and deliver for free.  Throwing a small credit says, forget that you are still hungry, we don’t care about correcting the problem nor working on making the service better.  Where is the acceptability.

"We placed a McDonald’s order which was delivered 1 hour after it had been prepared. As you can imagine it was inedible, cold mush (it had been sitting for so long that the paper straw wrappers had disintegrated into the actual straws). When complaining on the Uber eats phone line we were told by a customer service representative AND a manager that this was acceptable and within their guidelines (despite both admitting they wouldn’t eat food that was 1 hour old). When I asked what the acceptable guideline was for food preparation to delivery time I was refused this because they’ve apparently been instructed not to give out this information. As a customer I’d have thought I should have access to the guidelines in signed up to. In any event, the rude customer service manager eventually just hung up on me. The delivery on just eat and Deliveroo is cheaper and you actually have a chance at having an issue resolved if you have one.

Why did it take and hour to do a 5 min away drop?

"Dreadful customer service. I am based in a city around an hour from London, and UberEats is so bad in terms of customer service I have decided to abandon the app. Drivers clearly ‘multiapp’ here (which you can’t blame them for if they are not being paid enough by Uber) which means that even if you select ‘priority delivery’ or provide a good tip, they often drive in the opposite direction to the pick up restaurant and take ages to deliver. Customer service is terrible and practically non-existent when these issues arise: I never receive any help but what appear to be cut and paste stock responses.UberEats need to get their customer service in order or people will simply use different apps - which, while not perfect, at least have more reliable deliveries and functional customer service.","Date of experience: August 20, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,KS,Trust Pilot,,

"The worst ever food delivery company. I wish there was a rating zero rating for me to select. Twice this year Uber Eats drivers did not deliver the food I ordered. They just disappeared off the system. When I contacted Uber Eats on both occasions, the customer support told me that the driver had followed their procedure and had contacted me twice when that was not the case, as they did not ring me at all. Based on this Uber Eats refused to refund my money. They had standard answers every time I communicated with them via the help support. They could not think out of the box. In my opinion, Uber Eats has given their drivers an easy way to steal from customers. They only believe what their driver tell them even when they have taken your food for themselves. There is no accountability. It is so sad that you order food and their drivers steal it and Uber Eats don't do anything.Following the most recent incident, I have had to go to the retailer I ordered from and asked them to investigate and possibly look into not using Uber Eats anymore.","Date of experience: August 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Adenike Olunloyo,Trust Pilot,,

I ordered my meal and it said it was going to be delivered at 7:20pm. It kept getting delayed until finally 8:00pm I called the restaurant they said “oh your order is just sitting it hasn’t been picked up.” I then had to ask a friend to go pick up my meal and delivery it to my house as I was busy trying to put my kids to bed. Why would Uber send the restaurant the order if it doesn’t have a driver available to pick up the order?

"Extremely unhappy with the service from the driver and the customer service afterwards when I'm trying to resolve my concern. After 2 hours the driver cancelled the order. No call, no reason, nothing. I had to chase up the driver and follow up everything.  He stated that he had collected the food, and had it in his car on the way when he car trouble. After I followed up, he did appologise, however,  no instructions or reasons to follow. I did receive an automated reply from uber stating that the money has been refunded and I can now reorder again and they'll deliver it when possible. Firstly, a 2 hour wait, then it's cancelled. I received a message on my phone that my order was being prepared. Great. Then another message later that it's on the way with the driver. Good. However,  after I had to chase up what was going on, I called the restaurant and they said that the food was never collected and still waiting to be picked up. Not ideal. Then I ordered the same order a second time. Was charged by uber for placing a new order as directed by the ""support email"". Once again, your order has been collected and on the way by a new driver. Just under 3 hours later we receive the food. When we bring it in. It's stone cold. Further enquiries, the food was never made again, and it was the same food prepared when we placed the order now 3 hours earlier. Unable to consume food or reheat due to moving into a new place and awaiting for appliances to heat, cook or even warm the meals ordered. Hence the reason we ordered in. Now, it's been approximately 11 days and still no positive action has been provided or any customer feedback offered. It seems its all automated. They continue to reply with the same questions, replies,  and responses when I have taken 3 separate attempts to get this rectified. All I want, is a team member to either message me via social media or email to truly attempt to help me. I've waited over a week before submitting this feedback, hoping that after 2 attempts on my end that it'll be resolved. But after a 3rd try from my behalf, I get the same automated questions that I've actioned and answered. Extremely frustrating that a customer needs to follow up Uber Eats mistakes. And after 3 attempts....nothing is done about it.","Date of experience: August 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,ST,Trust Pilot,,

I liked that Uber got back to me. I didn't like that my issues isn't listed in their problem section. I have real simple issue and that is with Uber not confirming that my order was either accepted or declined. I had no know way of knowing if my food order was coming. This is has happened to me 3 times now. I was in dialogue with customer service rep I tried to explain one that I did not have an order id number and 2 that the restaurant must either confirm or decline order and let you know. In my first experience of this I thought my order had been cancelled as I called the takeaway and they told me they had no knowledge of my order . As I needed to get some food I went to another takeaway as I was about to my order in my son calls me that our food has arrived.

I gave him directions down the phone, he then said he was here. My partner and the receptionist had been waiting outside and looking for him through the CCTV the whole time he was on his way. It got to an hour and he hadn’t turned up when he said he was here. He then claimed to Uber eats people he had delivered it but then another person said he was waiting 20minutes and no nobody contacted him. They are nothing but liars. Not only did they take my money of £31.97 they also took my food and refused to give me a refund because “he followed procedure” . One of the colleagues laughed at me down the phone, the other guy was arguing with me and just said “anything else I can help you with”. This is not how customers should be treated or spoken to.

"The poor experience exceeded my order. To even resolve the extended delay delivery(1.5 hrs) I was on the phone and had 5 different rude chat agents. Then to have a supervisor call promised same day but to then get called twice 2 days later at midnight is ILLEGAL and wrong. When I reposted this, The reps keep emailing me stating “they are sorry for my order delay and cancellation.” Or send proof of order and when the calls happened. NOTHING! We are beyond resolving the issue of the order since I had to jump through hoops with rude agents for an hour after the order was delayed to finally get cancelled. To then get called 2 days later resulting in the lack of acknowledgment of this supervisors actions resulting in these reps copying and pasting a response is so unprofessional, frustrating and lack understanding. I provided proof of this supervisor calling me twice at 12:35am but I keep getting the “I’m sorry for your order” reply. Isn’t this against the FTC consumer laws on when and how companies contact you? And the fact I asked for an US based supervisor to address why I was called after midnight, I again keep getting the “we’re sorry for your order” cut and paste reply.

I ordered and confirmed then realised the delivery address was incorrect so was able to update the order in the app and app showed a confirmed updated delivery address.  However driver went to original address and was not contactable by phone and did not respond when i messaged him the issue.  I think he just dumped the food in the doorstep of the wrong address then took a photo claiming a successful delivery?? Trying to contact Uber has been a nightmare so far I have been charged in full and had no response about a refund.  I spoke to the restaurant direct who also had no way of contacting Uber.  Be ware when it works it great but when it doesn’t it’s frustrating and expensive I gad to reorder the whole meal.  The replacement meal arrived and was great but the original delivery driver didn’t do his job and probably ate my dinner given he knew he was delivering to no one at the address he arrived at!,"Date of experience: August 11, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,J-,Trust Pilot,,

I immediately check the help section and it advised to contact merchant, called them immediately and they advised they had no ability to cancel or edit order (due to uber fees etc), so contacted uber via chat and the 1st agent cut me off, spoke to 2nd agent and he advised couldn't cancel.Well now I have double the food needed, meaning half will go in the bin.

"Usually I'd understand when there's mistakes late at night, but it's been a few times now. First time I ordered Stella and got Budweiser (I didn't complain because the photos of the place were all messed up so I thought this might happen)2) I ordered a ""strawberry ice"" vape and got ""strawberry ice cream"". I could do a lot of flavour mixups but not that. 3) had a friend order £50 worth of beer and was quoted about 45 minutes. Several hours passed and we didn't have it. Finally called and went through a whole circle of them asking the postcode, saying it was going to be 20 minutes, and not getting it. At one point he also assumed I must be the wife of the man calling which felt insulting. Another point the shop owner hung up on us (I wanted to be mean at this point, but my mate took the phone and was lovely) Finally we got a call from the driver who was a solid hour at best away (this was roughly 3 hours after the order) and at this point it was easier to send someone to a shop to get everything at half the price.

"After repeatedly receiving promo codes for a substantial saving from Postmates (owned by UberEats), I placed an order. I needed to leave my house by 6:30 PM and I ordered before 4 PM. The estimated time of arrival was 4:40, and the latest time was estimated to be 5:05. This would have given me plenty of time. I kept watching the times change and finally called at 6:05. The driver still hadn't picked up my food and each time I checked his location he was further away from my house. He started out about 3 miles away and the restaurant is only about 1 mile away. At the time I contacted UberEats he was 3 towns away. The CS Rep told me I was next. Aside from the fact that I could no longer wait for my order, I can't imagine how awful it would be by then, after sitting around for 2 1/2 hours waiting to be picked up. The CS Rep actually tried to pacify me with 20% off of a future order! No. Just no. I canceled my order, and closed my account.

"The development team must be aware of this, because now there is a way for you to see in real time on the lock screen where your order isBut let’s say you’re not on the lock screen and you are wanting to look at your order. It is practically impossible to pinpoint yourself on the map because the receipt and the map size are too big. What would be a great addition would be a drop-down section for your orders, so you can properly navigate the Google map to see exactly where your order is Or better that allow the map to have its own individual page, because the map can be a little bit more in most cases more effective than the real time. At least you can see if they caught up in traffic. The concept of showing the map in the detail is great, especially if you’re visiting different areas and you don’t know the streets properly have an accurate map with all the traffic lights and stop signs But I really think it would be a lot beneficial for those people with larger orders to have a complete different page for tracking because this is absolutely horrendous, signed a fat fingered customer 😂❤️","Date of experience: August 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,IM,Trust Pilot,,

"I stopped using Deliveroo recently as the quality of their service has gone very downhill recently and now, I will no longer be using UberEats either. I have a long history of abysmal experiences with UE’s customer service but this latest experience  has truly been the straw that broke the camel’s back. I submitted a late evening order on August 5th from a nearby co-op, for 21 items totalling around £40. When the driver arrived,he handed me 1 bag with 3 items in it and asked for the code, which I gave him (assuming the rest of the bags were in his car) then he tried to leave and when I asked where the rest of the shopping was, he said he accidentally dropped it off at the previous address he was at and he’ll ‘go and get it’ and he’ll ‘be back in 10’, and before I could question him further he jumped into his car and sped off.Obviously he never returned. And of course, UE sided with him because I gave him the code. To be completely honest, this is the behaviour that I have come to expect of UE and Deliveroo delivery staff, as this kind of thing happens ALL the time across all these sorts of low paid zero hours delivery gigs. And while I have had countless frustrating experiences with UE’s customer service team, I have never had an experience this dire. Upon contacting UE immediately to report the incident, approximately 2 seconds later they came back with a copy-paste response to say they would not be refunding my 18 missing items, totalling £35 worth of groceries I never received. After days of back and forth messages on multiple platforms, they claimed to have investigated the incident fully, but refused to give me a single detail of their investigation and would not budge on their decision. In the end, I have filed a chargeback with my bank and that seems to be progressing in the right direction. I just really don’t think a company with such loathsome customer service rats can be a sustainable way to function. Such a deceptive and immoral company. Seriously, customers and employees alike need to stop putting up with this abhorrent service and boycott it.","Date of experience: August 05, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Kt Moon,Trust Pilot,,
I like that there are lots of options and pricing is clear. I dislike that queries are dealt with by a bot so much so I gave up in the end even though they’d put someone else’s address on my invoice.

"I switched to Uber Eats because both Doordash and Grubhub have screwed me over before.So far, things have been okay with them- but holy crap their customer service is full of morons.I asked a simple website question- where is the option to choose tip amount?- because I had placed an order, wasn't given the option to input tip, and then charged and extra $10 on a $22 order.They said they couldn't help me without logging into the email associated with the account. I just want to know if we can pick tips or if they changed that, and they will NOT answer me. The fact they can't answer a simple question is beyond ridiculous, especially one that involves more money for them.

"I would not give even one star for Uber Eats and its DRIVER whose name is JACKSON ANTONIO. Yesterday was my daughter's birthday. I live in Greenford. I ordered food from McDonald’s in the Westway Shopping Centre using Uber Eats. It was not the first time, and never ever any driver had any problem reaching my address. THE DRIVER DID NOT ARRIVE AT ALL! I saw on the app map that he stopped at the other end of the road, which was just a 1-minute ride from me. I texted him that he is in the wrong place and he needs to drive a little bit further, but he was messaging me back something in Portuguese. Then a message came that he tried to contact me, which was absolutely a lie. It was me who was trying to call him many times, but he just rejected my phone calls and I was texting him many times, no reply. Maybe because he did not speak English. After I got a message that he cannot localise my address and he had just gone away. Then I received the photo of my order being left somewhere outside the building. It was not my address. So disappointing. Kids were hungry. How can a driver be so irresponsible, with such bad communication? What he has done to my order I don’t know. I lost almost £18. Maybe it is not much, but how can I trust this company again, that allows such irresponsible people to work there, without knowing basic English? I complain to UberEats, but the reply was that I am not eligible for a refund, because the delivery person tried to contact me (which is FALSE) and he waited for 7 min to deliver the order (at the wrong address).","Date of experience: August 07, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Alina,Trust Pilot,,
"DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.  UBER EATS HAS FAKE REVIEWS, FAKE IDS for DELIVERY DRIVERS and they are aware of this and DO NOT CARE.Very bad and unethical company that really does not care about the retailer or the customer.  It only cares about money.I had a bad experience with an order which never arrived.  I tracked the delivery driver who visited several towns after collecting the order.  I spoke to the restaurant and discovered the delivery driver who was a MAN was using a FAKE ID that belonged to a WOMAN.  I reported this to Uber eats support.  They did not care about the non delivery, they did not care about the FAKE ID.  I thought the non delivery could be a common complaint but it appears so was the FAKE ID as the support were nonchalant suggesting this is not the first time this has been mentioned.  This coupled with fake reviews for bad restaurants which is also rife.  It suggests this is a bad company with failures at every level.

"I placed a large order with a restaurant based on its proximity and time to deliver. I received a confirmation moments later showing that the delivery would be much longer than I expected and I had a large number of small children to feed. I looked to see if it was possible to cancel the order and there was an automated cancellation request, when I selected it it said that the order had been canceled and that I owed a cancellation fee of $339, The entire amount of the order. This makes no sense since if I had to pay for it anyway I may as well have the food delivered. The cancellation was processed less than 5 minutes after the order that was supposed to take more than an hour to prepare was submitted. I immediately reached out to customer service and it took two days to finally get in touch with them. They refuse to refund my money based on the order having been submitted and the restaurant already beginning to prepare the food. I went around and around with them multiple times before calling the restaurant only to find out that the restaurant manager said that the restaurant was not paid for the order because it was canceled, and they never made the food.I disputed the charge with my credit card company because I never received anything for my payment. The money was refunded to me but now Uber is billing me for it. I have attempted to contact customer service I've told them the restaurant was unpaid and didn't make the food and they've done nothing but offer me a $25 credit. The problem is that now I can't use the app without first paying the $339. The $25 credit seems a poor exchange for $339 for food I never received .I wouldn't have probably worried about it if they had charged me a $25 cancellation fee or if they had told me in advance that the order could not be canceled or would be charged in full anyway but none of these things happened. As it is, they expect me to pay them $339 for food that they never made and never delivered. I have tried to appeal to them that I can no longer do business with them, and that in my lifetime I will be worth much more as a customer than this $339 but no one seems to care. They just repeat the same information which is that they can't refund it after the order has been placed but in that case I should have been made aware of the fact before it allowed me to cancel it.","Date of experience: August 07, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CK,Trust Pilot,,

"I don't use Uber because I have had issues previously with their Uber drivers, I know Uber don't care about anything but money. My friend ordered Uber eats to my place on the weekend, and the driver delivered the food and then left, whether he actually left I am not sure about. 30 mins after the delivery was handed to me, the driver was back and buzzing my unit, I answered the intercom as i assuming he dropped something inside the complex and needed to come get it. He told me he needed to use the toilet and asked if I would let him use mine. I decided to do the right thing because Uber probably wouldn't care to ensure their drivers have bathroom access, they are reputable for being a poor employer and poor service, so I let him in to use my bathroom. When he came out of the bathroom, I expected he would than me and leave, but he wasn't leaving, he stayed near the door, looking around at my place. He seen my cat and started calling it over to which it ignored. Then he proceeded to ask me if I lived alone which made it clear he was not there because he needed to use the toilet. He couldn't from where he was standing thay I had a friend with me, but as soon as I told him another person was with me, he very quickly got himself out of my unit. This is extremely dodgy as he clearly didnt come to my home needing a bathroom, he either never left and stayed for half an hour, or he came back to target me because I am a young female and he thought i was alone, and wanted to suss out if I lived there alone. My friend contacted Uber via the app and told them what happened becuse we both felt uncomfortable about what happened, and Uber just sent a generic response to pretty much say sorry for the experience, and shut the conversation off. They are not looking into this incident and the driver will continue to try look for single women who live alone. I already knew Uber would do nothing, it's typical Uber to not care.I am wanting to warn everyone about using Uber that their drivers are untrustworthy and will try and target perople home alone and try gain access after the delivery is done. Do not trust Uber! They allow this to happen under their watch. Stay safe and avoid Uber, you cant trust your address with their drivers as you may be targeted. I have never had this issue with any other delivery app, it seems to be an issue with Ubers drivers, and probably because they let them get away with it and do nothing. I am now banning anybody from Using Uber at my home, apparently not using Uber myesf wasn't enough to avoid their problematic drivers.","Date of experience: August 05, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NB,Trust Pilot,,

"I’d give zero stars if I could!I will never ever use Uber Eats ever again! Let’s get this straight I did an order one the 11th of June which I waited nearly an hour or over an hour as 6 times it said on the app there relocated a new driver, further more I eventually received my food which wasn’t food by that point as I received it all smashed up and liquids had gone everywhere and let’s just say I wasn’t aware until I put the bags on the sofa to then see there what looked to be ice cream and coke now bedded into it so had to someone to clean it up because Uber eat’s clearly wanted to be ido**, anyway they said on the phone mind you that if I’ve not received my refund by the 2nd of August then “ simply” contact them… we’ll there was no simply about it, I had a bad time trying to get hold of someone as they refused to speak to me because I didn’t have an open order because it gone past the 48 hour mark when not being funny how else am I meant to predict the fact I was never going to receive that refund, vicious cycle as they tell you to wait 2 months for the refund but when it’s not there they refuse to speak to you, so at that point they opened up an automated chat for me on the app which speaking to a wall would of been more helpful! So tried to add on there the fact I spoken on the phone at the time as i didn’t except to be on the app trying to demand my £33 pounds back !They kept giving me the scripted words of “ sorry for the inconvenience but without an active order we can not refund you as it’s gone over the 48 hour” Blar blar basically more like they make you wait for 2 months to then tell you are not eligible for a refund!","Date of experience: June 11, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,LB,Trust Pilot,,

"I put in an order from Amir Ile Perrot $44.A few minutes later, the uber driver messages me that he accepted the order by mistake and that I would need to cancel the order otherwise his ""score"" would be affected (sorry).I didn't even know I could cancel an order but after going through the help chat bot, I accidentally cancelled my order from being bombarded by chat messages and options when I was just trying to contact someone from Uber (which is way harder than it should be).Then after accidentally cancelling my order, I'm able to speak with a customer service agent who tells me I messed up and there's nothing they can do for me and I'm now stuck with a $33 charge for nothing in return. For additional context, I've never had any disputes on my account and I've been with them for years. After arguing with the person they offer my $10 to which I respond with my dissatisfaction and results in the agent telling me theyre sorry for me experience, have a nice day and ends chat.I escalate the conversation to Uber (not eats) and the second person tells me more or less the same thing but, this time, with a $25 credit. Again, I tell them how that's not good enough, the DRIVER WAS NOT GOING TO DELIVER (proof available in the chat logs with the driver). Finally after arguing for a while, they reluctantly offer me a full refund as a credit on my account.They never addressed the driver situation which is crazy and now I'm left with Uber eats PTSD and no food that I was supposed to receive an hour ago.","Date of experience: August 05, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nicholas Brown,Trust Pilot,,

"These delivery app companies are ripping consumers off wholesale! I've been trying each and every one of them for the first time this year and they're all the same. Somehow, in spite of charging you so much to deliver your order, you will either get sent the wrong order or some of the items will be missing. When you try to get a refund, you're given a store credit that doesn't even come close to covering what was lost.For instance, I ordered something today through Uber Eats for $12, which--when all put together--almost cost me $24. Okay, fine, I get that this is the price to pay for convenience, but at least have the decency to give me everything I ordered. In my case,  of course the costliest item was missing and I was only given a $2 credit for an item that was over $6! And I was charged almost $12 in fees, taxes and tips! But I only get $2 back?This is absolutely unacceptable, and Americans need to start contacting the attorney general in their state to go after companies like UberEats, Door Dash, etc. Take screenshots of your items, customer service response, etc. and write your attorney general!","Date of experience: August 04, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Stranded NYer StrandedNYer,Trust Pilot,,

"My recent encounter with Uber Eats left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. I had ordered from a merchant, but to my dismay, they cancelled my order right after I booked it. Annoyed, I had no choice but to place an order with another merchant, which thankfully got delivered eventually.The real nightmare began when I noticed the sum of £35.27 debited from my account for the cancelled order. Attempting to rectify the situation, I desperately tried to contact the merchant through Uber Eats, but surprise, surprise, there was no viable option to reach them! I had to resort to using Google search to find their contact details.Upon calling the merchant, they washed their hands of the matter and directed me back to Uber Eats, which, as it turns out, is no walk in the park to get in touch with. It's almost as if they purposefully avoid addressing pertinent issues like ""Why was I charged when my order was cancelled?"" in their Help page.After jumping through hoops, I finally managed to contact Uber Eats through an alternative means, but guess what? They outright refused to assist me since more than 48 hours had passed. Now, let me clarify that I did try to check my account just a day after the incident and noticed the amount was ""Pending."" So, naturally, I assumed the charge wouldn't go through.But no! Uber Eats decided to go ahead and charge me for an order that was cancelled by the merchant. What kind of absurd policy is that? Why should I be penalised for their inability to keep track of cancelled orders? It's ridiculous and infuriating!This whole experience has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I will think twice before ever using Uber Eats again. Their lack of customer support and the unjustified charges have completely shattered my trust in their service.

Customer service is not assisting me and keeps fobbing me off or the person I'm speaking to leaves the chat. I checked out an order for the desired items at the desired cost. Which I have a screenshot for. Then 20 minutes after checking when my food will arrive. It showed up more than double the price and added 2 extra items  WHICH I DID NOT CHECK OUT WITH. I tried to contact the resturant to stop the order as Uber Eats app had clearly glitched. No answer from the resturant. I then called and messaged the driver to say not to pick up my order. No response. Before my order came I then reached out to Urber eats online chat and was told they can only help me once my order was complete!?! And then as you guessed it left the chat. Spoke to various other members of your team for them to also leave the chat. One said the chat was only to discuss live orders and they cannot help as mine is completed. Contradictory to what the first person advised.Therefore when the delivery driver came I took what I rightfully ordered and told him to return the two extra items I did not order (but yet still paid for)I therefore want the refund for the two extra items I didnt order and didnt accept. I paid £41 for one chocolate waffle!!Please tell me why your customer service continues to fail me on every attempt I make to resolve my issue?I have opened a dispute with PayPal which was my payment method and I would appreciate somebody contacting me. I have a screenshot of my correct order total and a screenshot of when it changed. Luckily I was able to capture this as on a different section of your app it showed my true order.I want my refund that I am rightfully owed or I will be taking this matter further.

I was an Uber one customer too. Terrible experience and terrible CS. I’ve gone out of my way to give this poor review as I truly believe the public deserve better than what this company has to offer. I haven’t used them now for months and have received far superior service from others such as food hub and so much cheaper too. I have deleted their app, unsubscribed from their poor Uber one service and will never ever use this horrible company again. Even when trying to complain their app actually tipped the driver without me wanting to, and they even refused to refund that! Why would I tip a driver I’m trying to complain about.

Hence, I now take to Trustpilot to advise others to BEWARE of their criminal tactics in order to get away with this behaviour where they hold you to ransom.I mean, no wonder these drivers just give up with their delivery if they get paid anyway, right??APPALLING","Date of experience: July 29, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Anita Louise Combe,Trust Pilot,,

"@UberEats  I’m completely done with Uber Eats. One time I ordered donuts from Dunkin’ Donuts. Whoever the driver was had roaches in her car so my donut box had roaches in it it was so embarrassing because the order came to my office at a call center. I used to work to where I shared the donuts with other employees, who saw the roaches so embarrassing I contact Uber Eats support. They tell me I can get a refund strike one. Now yesterday a agent tells me I can’t get a refund because I canceled the order. Why would I want to keep my order that is in a totally different city. But one agent told me I couldn’t get a refund because I cancel the order but if I would’ve contacted them and had support cancel the order I would’ve gotten a refund that doesn’t make sense. Then another agent said I waited too long to cancel the order, but show them proof of a screenshot from my bank transaction. The order took place at 2:53 PM show them another screenshot of the transaction being canceled in the Uber app that says 2:53 PM, so how did I wait too long? And how did the restaurant except the order within that time? Then another agent I spoke with said she could give me a refund and never did. Strike two and strike three.

"Horrible customer service... The only service Ubereats is competent in providing, is daylight robbery. Twice now, I've had my refund refused, with no explanation as to why my wrong/ missing items do not constitute grounds for a refund. The two instances were as follows: 1) Ordered a protein bar, did not receive said protein bar (would not be surprised if the driver ate it enroute). Uber refused to refund me and was happy to take my money for something I did not receive. 2) Ordered 500g size of spanish omelette. Was charged for this size. Received a much smaller 250g omelette. Uber refused to refund me the difference - they've effectively stolen both my money and 250g of my omelette... Didn't realize that the £6.00/ month I pay for their uber one memebership was to sponsor their daylight robbery scheme... on their OWN CUSTOMERS!!!","Date of experience: August 02, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AC,Trust Pilot,,

"I ordered food on 28/07/23 and requested it to be delivered to my door. I added the entrance code to the building, the floor number and the flat number but the delivery person left it outside of the building instead. He sent a picture of the delivery, and it was literally on the floor, outside a building of 94 flats. When I went downstairs,it was no longer there. The delivery guy did call and I missed it (but called back a 4 minutes later to no answer). However there was NO need to leave it outside as he did. When I raised a claimed it was dismissed right away because it ""had been delivered"". No one read the details of what actually happened and they closed the claim right away. I raised a second one which was also dismissed because ""someone was already looking into it"", when in reality the other claim was already archived. I raised it yet again and all I got at this point was ""sorry but as mentioned before, we can't refund a delivery after 48 hours"". First, it had not been mentioned before, which shows they don't even read or check what has been said. And secondly, my original complaint literally happened minutes after the failed delivery. They have TWICE now sent the same message "" sorry but as mentioned before, we can't refund a delivery after 48 hours"" and nothing else. In 3 separate instances I asked to log an official complaint but it was ignored every single time. It's the worst customer support I've received in my life, on top of the terrible service I got for the delivery.

"I'm a delivery rider and I also order take aways frequently. I can say that between three major UK delivery apps which are Just Eat, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats; Uber Eats stands in last place while Deliveroo takes first. I rarely have any issues with Deliveroo since they were able to tackle its rider's wrong doings who were using fake GPS and hold orders while delivering food from other apps or even the same app in which the account might not even belong to them because most are illegal imigrants who pay rent for it.Just Eat has the similar problem and most riders use between 2-4 Stuart accounts (Just Eat), takes one order while holding their GPS from other mobiles in the same location, accepting an order in their different accounts, holding them there while doing another delivery.This really isn't fair for its costumers because they paid for the order and also for the delivery and they expect to receive the order nice and hot which rarely happens. I've e-mailed Stuart and Just Eat countless times trying to explain to them what goes on and they don't seem to care.The app that I consider worst for their customers, whose riders abuse their system is Uber Eats. Uber came up with a strategy to favor themselves but I believe it backfired on them and they are really losing money. Using as an example, Mc Donalds; If the riders accepts an order that is paying 2.70, most will not deliver it because it's not even worth the wait during pickup. What they do is accept the order but do not pick it up, wait for about 20 minutes then reject the order while a colleague of theirs is also waiting and see if that same order will popup on his mobile with an increased value which is usually doubled the original value. Depending on the riders, they keep doing it until it's paying above 10 pounds and they hope it pops up in one of their many rented uber accounts. I once ordered 2 milkshakes that took almost 2 hours to arrive and they were as warm as the sandwich that came with it and I knew they did this method with my order even when I messaged them asking them to please not do it. I reported them to Uber and I believe they did nothing about those riders which is very sad.As I said before, I'm a delivery rider and also a regular customer on these apps and I put myself inside the customers shoes when I deliver. I am terrified that these apps don't do anything to improve the customers experience while knowing that the major problems are the riders who are causing it.I'm only ordering my take aways with Deliveroo until these other companies decide to take action against these type of riders and start to favour their customers.","Date of experience: August 01, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,WT,Trust Pilot,,

"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. Very timely.  Very professional Uber Eats is a popular food delivery service that allows users to order food from local restaurants through a mobile app or website. Customers can browse through a variety of restaurants, choose their desired items, and have them delivered to their doorstep.One of the benefits of using Uber Eats is the convenience it offers. Users can track their order in real-time, receive notifications about the status of their delivery, and communicate with the delivery driver if needed. The app also allows users to save their payment information, making the checkout process quick and easy.However, like any delivery service, experiences with Uber Eats can vary. Some users have reported positive experiences, praising the speed and reliability of the service, as well as the wide range of restaurants available. On the other hand, there have been occasional complaints about delayed deliveries, incorrect orders, or issues with customer support.It's important to note that experiences can differ depending on various factors, such as your location, the specific restaurant you order from, and the availability of delivery drivers in your area. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about Uber Eats in your area, it's best to check reviews or ask friends or neighbors who have recently used the service.","Date of experience: July 26, 2023",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,CB,Trust Pilot,,
