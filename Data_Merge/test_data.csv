"First I was charged with a cancellation fee for a ride which never arrived, tried to contact the driver several times before canceling but couldn’t contact. Secondly got a completely wrong order from a wrong shop and when I tried to contact the delivery person it said the caller id is blocked, the only way I could complain was by e mails and got no replies for hours. Very disappointed with customer service. There are no any ways to contact and correct when such issues happen. Not gonna use any of Uber services hereafter. Not just once had to face such issues. Several times.","October 20, 2021",1,Priya,Consumer Affairs,"Homagama, Other",
"Horrible experience, the driver delivered someone else's order, I was able to give the wrong order to the driver but he did not have mine. After contacting uber eats support I was told they couldn't give me a refund or do anything for me, so I am supposed to be ok with not only not getting my food but loose $54 for the order because their system wouldn't allow them to refund me the money. Never have I dealt with a major company that did nothing to help and make me hold.","June 10th, 2023",1,John B.,sitejabber,,
"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store,,

"This was my first experience with Uber eats, and it was absolutely terrible, I will never use them again. I ordered groceries, received two extra items ($23 more than what I approved) and then was charged a $9 service fee on top of it, AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER. I contacted customer service and not only were they unhelpful and unprofessional, but they were also screwing with me, which included disconnecting me when I ask for a manager twice. I called to complain and the second rep refunded the money for the extra items, but would barely acknowledge my frustrations with the previous rep. He put me on hold to look into the service fee and then hung up on me! I called back and spoke to a female, who wouldn't even try to find the person I was previously speaking with, and then told me they wouldn't be refunding the service fee I did not approve. It was almost as if the previous rep prepped her for the call… She basically told me they would rather lose my business than make it right. If I could give negative stars, I would. Someone needs to look into a Uber regarding these fees they're adding. There's no way that's legal!

"I tried this service for the first time and what a joke. They give you an estimated delivery time knowing that the driver is going to do a ton of other stops before he gets to you. SO now it is an hour later and your food has been driving around in the U drivers car getting stone cold. No communication from the driver even thought I expressed my concern to him. Just crickets. My driver Bruce 693EOc was horrible and so is their customer service. I just sat there and watched as he kept extending the time for delivery. It just kept getting worse and worse.

"I was an Uber One user for a good amount of time, but not anymore. Most of my orders lately have had one or two items missing, and when I would go to Help to get my money back for the missing item, it would say it's refunding me. I would have it go back in Uber Cash, only to have a message pop up shortly after saying the order is missing a payment. Help said it was a missing ""tip"" payment, but I talked to drivers recently, and that ""tip"" isn't for them.

Uber service is not the best anymore. There are so many issues especially with the delivery. The driver keeps on changing. Sometimes the driver shows staying with the order at one place and when you message them they won't reply even if they see the message. At one point they just literally threw the food and ran away. At times the food didn't get delivery at all. What the heck has happened to them.vl,"August 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Aaushi Ujjain,Google Play Store,,
Always just way too expensive sometimes the drivers do a good job other times they don't directions for drop off are often ignored. I'm never notified that my food is here in a way that I actually get the message it would be nice if a driver could beep their horn or tap on the door or yell Uber eats or something.

"UberEATS was great! We ordered Crumbl cookies as a birthday treat for our son who lives 1700 miles away.  They were delivered to him in less than an hour!  The driver was great, even calling to make sure we wanted the order (because we had trouble understanding the app and made a mistake.)  My only criticism is that when the order was processed the total shown did not reflect the discount.  The promotional discount WAS applied, but we almost cancelled because we thought it was not applied.  Overall we were so happy with our experience.

"I ordered groceries from Walmart and got a 40% off from a promo that was going to end within the next 12 hours. Everything worked fine. I got the order delivered and the next morning I noticed that the promo was later removed and I was charged 40 dollars more than the invoice. What was even more surprising is that the bill has also changed! There was no trace of the expired promo on the app either. When I contacted support, they said they couldn't help without a screenshot of the promo I used! I showed them my credit card transactions that I was initially charged 60 dollars and later they charged me 100 by crediting 60 but they wouldn't help. It felt so like a genuine scam to me. Stay away from this app if you can. It's the $#*!tiest ever.

"I am extremely disappointed with the way Uber Eats has handled my recent order. I placed an order with Eagle Pizza, but the food was not delivered correctly. I tried to resolve the issue with Eagle Pizza directly, but they were unable to do so within 72 hours. Eagle Pizza offered to refund me, but they said they would need to do so through Uber Eats. I contacted Uber Eats, but they refused to refund me because the 48-hour refund window had lapsed.  I ordered a Pepperoni Passion Pizza (Double Pepperoni & Double Cheese) on Uber Eats on 12 August 2023. When the pizza arrived, it was dry and had only one or two pepperoni on each slice. There was also very little cheese.  I called the restaurant the next day to complain, but the manager was unavailable. I was told that I should have called within 15 minutes of the pizza arriving, but it arrived after closing time. The restaurant offered to send a replacement pizza at 11pm, but it never arrived. I called again the next day to complain about my replacement pizza, and I was again told that the manager was unavailable. The restaurant promised that the replacement pizza would be a priority and that they would send it at 11pm, but it again never arrived. I have decided not to call or chase over a pizza. I explained my circumstances to Uber Eats, but they did not escalate my complaint. I feel like the person I spoke to was incompetent and did not understand my situation. I am very disappointed with the level of customer service I have received from Uber Eats.

"Awful customer service and awful staff. This company deserves 0 stars. Their staff are rude and inexperienced. Getting hold of them is literally impossible. They allow restaurants to leave customers waiting over the time for delivery. When you have no choice but the cancel, they fully charge you for it. The restaurant I ordered from was taking orders but was clearly closed. Not only did me and my family not eat that night, they robbed us of £30 quid and they offered no support or apology. They are completely morally wrong. I would avoid using this service like the plague.

"I strongly advise against using UberEats for food delivery. During my recent vacation in Amsterdam, I placed an order for 100 euros, but was dismayed to find that two items were missing, one valued at 25 euros and another at 4 euros.Upon discovering the issue, I promptly contacted UberEats to address the missing items. To my surprise, they only refunded the 4-euro item. Frustrated, I reached out again, specifically inquiring about the 25-euro item, to which they responded, ""We already refunded the missing items, and the matter has been resolved.""This experience left me utterly perplexed and dissatisfied with their service. Back in my home country, I typically use WOLT, despite its lower rating compared to UberEats. However, WOLT consistently provides excellent customer support, promptly addressing any missing items and ensuring customer satisfaction.It's disheartening to encounter such subpar service from a well-established organization like UberEats. Additionally, their app's interface leaves much to be desired in comparison to their competitors.Given the availability of alternative options, I strongly discourage using UberEats if you're seeking a reliable and responsive food delivery service.Update:They refunded the money now after some discussion, hence abit better rating","Date of experience: October 22, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,CH,Trust Pilot,,

And when i couldn't connect the driver back after he called me once  to get my food from him. It just doesn't let me connect to the driver and he has gone somewhere else with my food which is fantastic because when i call the restaurant they are not in control of the drivers. UBER STOP MAKING ME CALL YOU AND BEING THE MIDDLE MAN JUST LET ME CONTACT THE PERSON WITH THE FOOD. MY ORDER WAS NOT CANCELLED BUT IT SAID DELIVERED WHEN IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED. I JUST COULDN'T PICK THE FOOD UP BECAUSE MY PHONE WAS OFF AND I WAS BUSY WITH WORK. (I HAD ORDERED FOOD TO MY WORK PLACE).

Uber eats is the problem here. This isn't the first time we have had problems with them, but last night they sent me a 50% off coupon and I said let's give it another shot. That was a mistake! I ordered at 5:15pm and the restaurant is only 3.4 miles away. 5:35pm the food was picked up and the app said my delivery person was on a bike which concerned me. The short trip is much longer on a bike, and a trip I wouldn't want to take personally. Also the time for delivery shot up to 6:10pm latest delivery time as they put it. We'll that came and went. I text the driver and they claim to not have my address which I promptly text her. Another few minutes pass and according to the app driver hasn't moved. Uber calls me around 645pm asking if it's ok to give the driver my address. Of course they would need an address to make a delivery, have these people lost their mind? I tell them just cancel and refund my money. They then tell me that's another department. Great so I hang up with them. By now it's 7pm we are hungry and no food according to app this delivery person is just sitting at the gas station, probably eating my food. So I get back on the app to get help finally find the correct combo of buttons to push and they cancel my order. They made sure to let me know i wouldn't be charged for canceling my order! Now this really pissed me off! First of all...if they miss that latest delivery time you are entitled to a full refund. Second trying to make out like they did me some kind of a favor canceling my order for free is BS. I reordered from the restaurant picked it up myself at 725pm and back at the house by 735pm.

Then the £5 credit that is supposed to be offered for late deliver was not applied as the order was cancelled. I called and nobody could give me the credit as a simple quick fix over the phone. Instead they wanted to enrage the customer by having them jumpy through hoops for £5. They cheekily cancelled the order before it could be late just so that I didn’t receive the £5 credit. Dodgy practice and poor customer service. Something that could be resolved so easily by a call operative crediting me the £5 and now my night is spoiled and no food. No credit and why am I paying them for this Uber one service!,"Date of experience: December 14, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Oliver Lewis,Trust Pilot,,
Very unreliable with the promotions/discounts.I had a 5€ discount which was applied at checkout but after submitting the order and paying it charged me full price without the discount.The fact that its imposible to contact support via the app or any other method says everything about this company.,"Date of experience: January 19, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Oliver,Trust Pilot,,

Zero customer service Refused to refund a delivery that was never received (driver was sent to the wrong address due to a known fault with their app).

"I am so tired of ordering food and not receiving it. UberEats, all of the delivery services now, are a big scam. The restaurant doesn't have any responsibility after the food leaves the store. UberEats doesn't have a customer service number to correct things instantly. If they do, they keep it hidden because the only number I saw and called was for drivers. I can get a refund, but it takes ten days to receive the money back. Thanks for nothing.","September 29, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Rae Barker,Google Play Store,,

"Used Uber eats for the first time today and it was a nightmare. The driver who accepted the order never picked it up. First Uber eats support agent ended the chat with me just saying to wait longer. The second one reassigned a rider but now the food has been on the counter for 1.5hours.. I was denied a refund upon cancellation request, quoting that ""the restaurant already prepared the order so they get to keep the cost"", but then Uber should cover the cost of missed delivery which they refused.

I am a physician and spend 12+ hours per day at the hospital, my time at home and to prepare for the next day is very limited. Not only did I not receive my order but it was then too late to order from anywhere else and the customer service response was to repeatedly say that I “was not charged.” Uber Eats clearly does not care about retaining customers.

"Really the worst kind of customer service you could possibly have. The app made an error and added an extra item for me that I couldn't remove and this extra item was charged to me. Trying to get this taken care of, to refund a single item, has been a kafkaesque nightmare of the highest order. They have a chat bot first you need to get past which keeps kicking you out of the chat, then when you finally get to a representative they keep giving the same answers and saying they can't do anything, all the while making you wait for ages. Finally after spending close to half an hour of your precious time trying to get an error caused by THEIR app to be fixed, they say they will forward it to a team who will get back to you and close the chat in your face. Almost every 2nd time I make an order with this company I regret it. Then I promise myself I won't order with them again, and usually I last 2-3 months or so of not ordering with them, but then I kind of forget how bad it is and make an order, and then it turns out, it's not just as bad, it's worse each time!

"absolutely terrible service. refused to fix their own problems.I ordered £30 worth of mcdonals from uber yesterday. 2 meals for me and my partner. firstly my big tasty arrived without tomato, it says no tomato on the label and i most definitly did not ask for that, the whole reason i like the burger is because of the tomato.  My partner ordered the chicken selects meal along with a fruit bag. when the order arrives there are no chicken selects and there is no fruit bag. they INSTEAD sent a triple cheese burger and a chicken mayo without any topping and cheese added to it.... How on EARTH did the restaurant think that was an okay replacement. he is LACTOSE INTOLERANT so was not able to eat any of the meal. i also ordered an apple pie which never arrived. at first i thought i was given the wrong order. the the bag receipt is correct, its just whomever packed the order clearly cannot read and should not be working with food!

"We use all the food delivery services. DoorDash, grub hub, postmarked, and Uber eats. This is the only one that never delivers my full order. I ordered on 1. 31. 22 and half the order was missing. They process a return for the missing stuff and that's it. No fee pro rate, no tip pro rate. Then says in chat to just place a new order.

So you want me to place a new order, pay the tips and delivery again without guarantee I get it? Ridiculous.

I ordered again today 2. 1. 22 and same thing. Missing half the order, same speech. The only app that this happens with. So once again I will have to grab something from the fridge so my son and wife don't have to eat cold food.

Awesome job Uber eats.

We're sorry for the inconvenience that this caused you, Susan. This is Chlerian, Manager from the Customer support team.
Thanks for letting us know about this. As I've checked the details, several orders have price adjustments or refunds. Because of this, we won't be able to provide you with a price adjustment on this order.
You can rate and leave feedback to your delivery person or merchant in the app. The feedback you've provided will help us work with the merchants and delivery people to improve the order experience.

I also received once again an another email (attached) from Ubers Eats with a promo code of 30% off orders of $50 or more.

After an hour and a half of going through all of their BS i told them to forget it I would order through grubhub. Now this month they sent me another coupon same code so I sent a message to their customer service telling them to stop sending me codes that don't work went through all of what happened last time because now apparently now they have some kind of block on my account because got mad last time. Now I am going through it all again with these idiots. It is like they have nothing better to do than to bother people, and give them fake coupons.
Tip for consumers:
Just don't bother they are way more trouble then they are worth.

"I order from Uber eats A LOT. I don’t usually have an issue however whenever I do have an issue I don’t feel like it’s ever actually being resolved. Let’s say an items missing, they will refund that missing item only. In most cases this is part of someone’s meal and now someone has less than ordered it ruins the whole meal at times and if I’m just getting an item refunded then why the hell would I order in the first place. If I didn’t want it I would order it. So being like oh sorry here’s 2 quid back is completely useless because the whole convenience of ordering is he sole reason. Not to then get only what I paid for and wait for refund of said item then have to go through the gruelling process of having to go on the app an and complain to get the refund when I should be eating. It’s completely infuriating.I had a driver have a McDonald’s drink spill all over the paper bag. He hands it to me. I have a carpet in my hallway and had to scrub it after. I told him I didn’t want a bag of liquid which is now all over my carpet and he leaves spilling in from my door to the exit of my apartment block. Uber refunded less than the price of the drink I had to complain for about 4 hours back and foward through emails at this point what is the point.I pay for the app too, but enoughs enough.

"Extremely disappointing customer service. I had placed an order for Buy 1 get 1 free - it didn't add that to the cart, and told me that I have to add 2 items to get that offer. I had done this in the past and the second 'free' item was automatically added to the cart. When I called customer service immediately, the person (Tony) could barely speak English and understand the issue. He kept me on hold for ~7 mins to come back and say the order cannot be canceled, since the merchant has already started preparing. When I asked him to call the merchant and add the second item, he informed me that cannot be done and that I have to call them. I called the merchant only to be told that Uber Eats has to do it online. This went on for several phone calls placed by me - and the end result was zero. When asked to connect to a supervisor, they informed me it was against their policy to connect to a supervisor.
Uber Eats has been consistently late, delivering cold food and with increasing service charges, the services are decreasing. I hope my review reaches the correct authorities, and they can look into the issue. Also, it would be really helpful, if they hire customer service operators who can speak and understand English.

"We all know Uber Eats is not free. They have fees and tips on top of taxes and cost of order. They don't care if the order is wrong, if you have missing items or if there is a constant complaint with one specific restaurant. Instead, they blacklist you for making too making complaints or requests with no attempts to reach out to those restaurants or blacklist them for inaccurate service. But again, we can't complain with our hard earn money. Too many orders are wrong or have missing items and they do nothing about the order or OUR money. Are they paying? NO! But they sure aren't correcting issues either. This Burger King in Houston did not send me a frozen coke—I got a regular—completely forgot to include my whopper, ice cream that resembles a milkshake, sent me overly cooked, cold and salty onion rings and nuggets, provided no condiments or utensils whatsoever and do not bother answering their phone (neither web nor receipt number). Trust me, I called within 2 minutes of my delivery and got no answer anywhere. Uber doesn't ever help—they disclaim but are quick to take your money and if you've made more than one complaint (yet you have dozens of cab rides and food orders under your belt) you get an automated message about why they won't assist or refund you. Now I don't want a refund, I want to give bad reviews for service. If I could report them to the bbb, I would. Everyone who gives bad service should be reported. PERIODT!

"Placed order through my mcdonald's app at 1010 this morning and was told it would be here by 1040. At 1030 I received a phone call from the courier who said they couldn't find my address and was on a street that was nowhere nearby. I informed him that I wasn't sure where i was going as I'm new to the area and could he bare with me while I found exactly where he was. His response was rude to say the least and said I've got other deliveries to make and was refusing to wait. Rather than cancelling my order he put it down as delivered so I was extremely annoyed by this. I phoned uber eats themselves and told them the situation hoping to get this resolved and maybe get a refund. I was greeted by a woman who was extremely unhelpful and rude to say the least. She then went onto say ""the driver had followed guidelines"" therefore was our own fault and wouldn't be able to get refund.

When trying to explain to cs the issue they didn't even acknowledge the problem just kept insisting if I cancled I would still be charged the 113.00 for the order as it was out for delivery. After explaining I didn't think the order would even arrive given it was a 90 minute. Bike ride they just blew me off staing the order would still arrive on time. I spent over an hr trying to get this resolved with nothing from them. I will never use their service again.

It's hard to leave a tip when delivery fee service fee and taxes are over $10.00 on it's own. Shame cause I love to give tips. There has to be something else that can be done. Maybe delivery fee goes to the actual delivery driver and not the store or uber whomever it goes to now. The service fee go to uber and taxes go to establishment.

"Ubereats delivery driver honest experienceI am writing this review as an ubereats delivery DRIVER. This is by far the most dysfunctional, slow app to work for. Not as bad as instacart, but could be better. First off, you either have to work in the morning-early afternoon or evening. If you are looking to get a decent order between the hours of 2 and 5pm forget it. You might as well download netflix and watch a film, because you will RARELY if ever get an order at the time. So now you have to either wake up super early for the morning/lunch surge or do the dinner rush from 5-9, sometime...

"After years of giving Ubereats loyal and frequent service, I have finally decided to stop using it cold turkey. I advise avoiding  Ubereats unless you have no other option. They are notoriously bad at refunding legitimate mistakes on their end (ex. missing items, wrong items, and legitimate safety concerns). I have let these things slide over the past year(I really should have stopped using their service months ago).  But this past couple months with mistake after mistake and not being refunded, I was basically throwing money in the trash can. Yesterday was the final straw for me. I chipped a tooth on the food I ordered on the app (there was something hard in the dish that shouldn't have been in it). I had to throw it away and now deal with a chipped tooth which is more time and money and an overall upsetting experience. I explained the situation to Ubereats and they did not refund me one penny for this order that cost me almost 50 bucks that went in the trash and resulted in a chipped tooth. I will no longer use Ubereats. Additionally their customer service is awful, they do not help you with legitimate concerns or do any investigations when it comes to safety, they did not even refund me for this situation at all.","Date of experience: December 02, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DC,Trust Pilot,,

"After initially emailing and explaining that the app had suggested the food would not arrive for 3 minutes (it kept saying that it would be another 3 minutes for nearly 20 minutes), and that they should look into their app they suggested I rate the driver and call the restaurant.

First of all, I've told them that the concern is the application itself (that they should look into) which after emailing them again, they explained that I should rate the driver and call the restaurant. What? Either they don't read their emails properly or their Customer Department is just told to throw out canned responses regardless of what the issue is.

If in fact, somehow this issue was the result of the driver or the restaurant, Uber Eats doesn't seem to take any responsibility for the third parties that they are affiliated with. I've used Skip the Dishes and have only occasionally used Uber Eats. I will no longer being using Uber Eats. Skip the Dishes when faced with issues, take accountability for the product, not directing the customer to follow up.

"I made an order through their website to send some food to a person who had come down with covid and their family could use some dinner. The Money was debited from my account and of course the food never showed up. When I called the customer service number it said the number was shut down until further notice. So now the money is out of my account and the family didn't have the food. I can't use the money to go buy other food because it is already out of my account. I know that it may come back in a couple of days but it does me no good right now. I was also never notified that the food wasn't delivered. What a horrible experience. Do not use this company. You will be better served to forage in the woods or use a different company. They really need a legitimate customer service number! The fact that they get one star is a joke. They shouldn't get any stars.
Tip for consumers:
Don't use Uber Eats. That's the best tip I can give. You may have money debited from your account and not have any food. They will not notify you that the order isn't coming and there is no legitimate customer service number to call to help straighten things out. I would think there would have to be some laws concerning this so that people conduct fair business, but I guess not.

"Genuinely the worst service I have ever received. They have taken no responsibility for an incorrect order, referred me back to McDonald's who referred me back to Uber eats.  Uber eats then referred me back to McDonald's and refused to escalate my call. They said it had already been escalated (it hadn't). More I'm stuck with no food and a charge of £18 that nobody is taking responsibility for. McDonald's support line is closed and Uber were just plain rude.

"Placed an order through the McDonald's app that came to just over £26, and UberEats was to deliver it. We're sat in the living room keeping an eye out the window for the driver to pull up, and also have a dog who never fails to hear someone approaching the house. Get a text to say it's been delivered. Bit odd that there was no knock, and also that we didn't see or hear anything. Opened the front door and there's nothing there. Called UberEats and they refused to give a refund, as according to them, the delivery was completed without any issues. £26 spent, no takeaway, and essentially called a liar when I contacted customer services. If you don't want the risk of having your evening ruined like this, don't use them.

"AWFUL service and customer service. Missing item reported with cost of nearly £8, it was the main item. Called them to complain and was offered a refund to the amount of £2. When I queried this, I was told that as I'd ordered the item as part of a meal deal cost £10, they could only refund £2 as 1 out of 3 items were missing. When I queried this again I was told it was their's, and the restaurants policy to do this. When I again queried why it was £2 and not the £8 minus the discount (£2.51 so refund of £5.49), she said they divide it by 3 as its a 3 item meal. This again made no sense as £10÷3 does not equal £2! I asked for an email or number to call to complain further up and was told there wasn't one. Rude and illogical service. I then called the restaurant, who said this was not their policy and sorted me out with a replacement at a later date.","Date of experience: January 16, 2024",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Kay rowe,Trust Pilot,,

"Gave us the wrong order after waiting for ages for it. It wasn't even a meal for myself but for my kids due to that fact I'm dealing with gallstones and in alot of pain that I have to take morphine and just needed to sort out them dinner so ordered them McDonald's for a treat too. I know for a fact the other order wasn't far away but I don't know the address so couldn't swap it back but your driver can't be asked to fix the mistake he made. I'm getting fed up with taken a risk with Uber eats. I get missing items, wrong items or you just don't deliver the food and then put on the app it's been delivered. Sort it out. I don't understand how some of the workers managed to keep their jobs with making so many mistakes. I'm in a terrible amount of pain but now I need to quickly sort out dinner for my kids before bedtime. This is so unfair, waiting around for this. I'm so disappointed. I hope you never get gallstones so can't  experience the pain I'm in. This has putting me in the hospital multiple times due to the pain making feel like I can't breathe. The order we did receive wasn't even enough to feed my 3 kids. Plus it was a one off treat as I find McDonald's too expensive now to get. I'm so disappointed, so disappointed...

"This should be zero stars. Made order, rider arrived, but as he was trying to explain (with very limited English) that the order had spilled, the entire order fell out of the bag and on to the dirty ground. Messaged Uber Eats through the app with photos and a screen flashed up to say the full amount paid would be refunded.  A few hours later, with no refund confirmation email and the full transaction still pending, I repeated the process and this time a screen flashed up stating a partial refund would be issued and this time a refund email was sent. Partial refund? For no service and nothing delivered? Are you kidding me? That is essentially theft. Since then no further responses from UberEats to any of my messages and it is impossible to actually call and speak to anyone to resolve this.

"It took an hour and a half to get my food! There is absolutely no recourse for your inconvenience and neither can you cancel the order.

Then the food is delivered cold. So I'm being forced to take food that isn't even ready to be served. Absolutely the worst! DISGUSTING

Disgusting how they treat customers. They delivered food to the wrong address. My address hasn’t changed since I had the app (4+ yrs) but the delivery invoice had the wrong address.

"I ordered a meal for $56.62 at 3:01 and canceled it at 3:02. The meal probably wasn't prepared yet, and the driver probably wasn't anywhere close to my house or the restaurant. Yet I was still charged. When I tried to file a complaint they said it was on me as the order went through? I contacted my bank and had them deal with it Uber eats responded over two weeks later saying that I was at fault. I contacted the uber eats customer service number and now that it had been over a month I had to take the L and pay the amount so I wouldn't get charged by the credit company.

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IF AN ORDER IS CANCELED THAT THE CUSTOMER IS NOT CHARGED FOR IT! $56.62 IS NOT A SMALL AMOUNT, I WORKED MINIMUM WAGE and tried to order for my whole family BUT NOOOOOOOOOO DIDN'T WORK OUT SO I CANCELED RIGHT AWAY AND STILL GOT $#*!IN CHARGED.

"I signed up with them and used them one time. I liked the driver and the online way to track the delivery. Fortunately, there was driver information (photo, phone number), as I had to call him. The reason for the call was ridiculous, and here's the story: I use a PC, not the phone app, and when I signed up on the site, I eventually realized that the system did not ask for my address, just an e-mail to verify the account and a phone number. I had to call the driver to give him my address. He was very pleasant and delivered the food without a problem. I spent a lot of time afterwards researching how I could enter an address for future deliveries. Directions on the site for changing an address through the app were given, but there is no way to deal with address issues on the web site. Also, I researched on the site and then on Google to try to find a way to contact the company. I found a phone number that doesn't take calls, and there is no way to e-mail them. From reading other reviews here, apparently using the phone app isn't necessarily an effective way to make contact either. I eventually gave up and requested that the account be deleted. I guess the system is able to help in only that way. I got a ""forced choice"" listing of reasons to select why I was leaving. I selected ""problems with ubereats"" and expected that the next screen would give me a narrative box to record my problem. But, NO! I got a thank you and that's it. What a bad way to lose a customer who would have given them a try.

"Uber decided to limit my delivery options because they said and I quote, ""to many items being returned to store""  ""too many items undeliverable""! So if a customer is not available for instance I went to a guarded community and the customer was unavailable and guard would not let me through.  I called twice, he called twice and I waited but couldn't wait to long I had 12 other deliveries.  Just like UPS or FEDEX they don't wait they have a timed schedule.  The other day (2 days ago) I had a delivery to one address but 8 of the items had to be scanned separate. Essentially that means the customer order each item separately.  I knew this was very odd and unusual so I called the customer.   The delivery address was to Garden Grove, CA and the customer who's acct got charged lives in NY.  She said I tried to contact Walmart to tell them I have fraud on my bank acct.  I said OH Nooooo so I told her I will take them all back to Walmart.  She said thank you.  Mind you WE DON'T GET PAID FROM UBER IF NOT RETURNED.  I had to return no only the customer that had the Guarded gate community home but the fraud items which totalled 9 items.  Gee I thought I was doing a good deed by calling her to let her know something was fishy.  I returned the items and I did call UBER Customer Service.  She documented it for me and said you will get pad for returning them.  Im thinking ok like $5 or $10 bucks.  my total delivery and believe me these are SLAVE WAGES,  $25 for 6 different cities and I drove ALL OVER the place like usual.  Honestly im almost losing money because inflation.  I take the items back to Walmart.  Two days later Uber puts a message on my acct.  We are limiting your delivery options because WE FOUND FRAUD ON YOUR ACCT.  WOW........Now doesn't that just sound coincidental!!! I return a bunch of items but then all of a sudden fraud on MY ACCT.  So I wait a day.  Today this morning I got a message from Uber stating You can no longer do CERTAIN DELIVERIES.  Which now LIMITS MY INCOME EVEN MORE!!! So I document my delivery by copying my deliveries I did the other day and how much they paid me.  VERY STRANGE I got paid $86 dollars instead of $25 for returning them to Walmart.  I asked myself why so much more?  but Im slaving daily so I graciously accept it of course.  Ive done 1700 deliveries for this slave job!  Then I look at the full payment for Uber as well.  OMG they made a lot of money from this Whole fraud thing!!! A LOT!!!! Then I asked myself ""who pays for all this""?  does Walmart lose money and pay Uber??? Or is the poor lady who's acct information was stolen pay for all those fees and it was like $102 dollars SOMEONE LOST because of fraud on the poor ladies acct. Uber made a total of $156.80 for all deliveries.  I wish I could have saved her number to make sure she didn't get screwed.  Another lady that day was not home and in a gated community I couldn't get into and called and no answer.To sum it up ""IM THE ONE"" being punished because if someone isn't available and I can't access their property to drop off their item and or now these fraud items being returned its MY fault  for any given reason I could not legitimately deliver.  Now Im not allowed to do Walmart deliveries.  That was a good chunk of my income taken away from me for reasons not my fault.  Thats not all I noticed they get out of paying the ""healthcare stipend"" by not accepting my healthcare insurance card""  ITS INSURANCE!!! they keep asking me to send them a photo of it for 2 years now they won't accept it.  No answer as to why!  I don't like that Uber NEVER has a HR dept.,  NO MANAGER TO TALK TO, NO MESSAGING AREA unless you have an ongoing conversation about an issue, you only get to deal with these out of country foreign customer service people that you barely understand the accent.  SUCH SCAMMERS!  They get the scammer award of the year in my onion.  THANKS UBER FOR TREATING YOUR BEST ""DIAMOND"" UBER DELIVER LIKE CRAP (A SLAVE) THANKS A LOT.....

"I ordered from the app, and applied the promo for a discount of $12. I cancelled the order when the receipt did not show the discount. I sent a chat to ask them why it did not show the discount, after I placed the order. I was on hold for 10 minutes, cause there were 10 people ahead of me. The girl said you cancelled the order, so it didn't matter. Then I get an email that stated that since the restaurant has started my order, I still had to pay for it. When I cancelled it, they had not started it yet. So I had to overpay for food I never got. What a rip off
Tip for consumers:
Beware, they will cheat you. They cheated me out of $35.00, for food I never received.

I love Uber eats. I use it all the time for personal and for my job. I work in a Emergency Room and it's very convenient to have Uber Eats so we could get something to eat because we don't have the time so it's so convenient. Also if something's missing from your order Uber eats will look into it and then give you Uber cash back if you pay for something you didn't get.

The level of involvement and refunding to get maybe half my order makes this app not useful at all.

If i could give 0 stars i would have but have to press one to allow to leave review. Ordered food through Mc Donald's app watched one the app the delivery driver stayed on Queensway when clearly stated service road 20. Then had a pop up saying order delivered. Believe me it was not i have 2 dogs that the slightst noise outside my house they bark and nothing checked out back and front nothing waited a liLittle longer still nothing. Called uber eats to be told she's took a picture outside our front door so will not issue refund. So no refund and no food. I stated I will take a picture of my front door/garden to show it wasn't left outside my door. Again told me due to her taking picture they will not refund. So the uber driver went to the wrong property proceeded to take picture of food outside and then picked it back up and drove away with order. Have been to the address where picture was taken no car on drive and curtains drawn so no one at home. So delivery driver stole the food and uber refuse to refund money. Absolutely disgusting I have contacted the police and give her details and phone number as when it hadn't been delivered when it said it had myself and my partner both called the phone number given and our numbers had been blocked.

"I ordered scheduled delivery yesterday and the delivery person came with order from wrong restaurant. I said this is not from where I ordered. He said he will check with customer service and after sometime the order was cancelled saying the Delivery person could not contact me. When I reached out customer service, they said order is getting delayed and will have to wait for some more time. When contacted a little later, I was told order is cancelled and I will not even get refund for that.
When I explained what happened, they were hesitant to listen and when asked to contact higher level, she said I will be contacted shortly after I disconnect and haven't received a call until this point of time.
I have experienced this issue several times and it is a lesson to be away from them.

"THIS COMPANY TREATS ITS DRIVERS TERRIBLY, DONT WORK FOR THEM. Let me start by saying that ordering food from this company is a rip off, for the customer and the driver. The average pay per trip as a driver for uber eats is $2 no matter the distance, so any real money is made through tips. Their system will also miscalculate trip earnings and give you trips where the restaurants are closed or the restaurant can't make the food, be careful if you cancel trips too many times it's YOUR FAULT, whether you call to verify a closed restaurant or not. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. My account was wrongfully deactivated due to ""cancelation fraud"" it was Christmas eve and their system gave me many trips where the restaurants were closed early, I verified every order over the phone, the next day without warning my account was permanently deactivated. You try to call and you get uneducated, unprofessional, sensitive, morons from the Philippines that will not help you or give you any reasoning as to why your account is terminated, and then you will be hung up on for ""being rude"".

Absolute joke. I only used the app for a specific delivery when I received the order my chicken (£31 worth) was raw and the restaurant told me I had to raise a complaint to them.

I had a problem with their web interface randomly switching the language on their website. I tried to contact them to see if we could solve the problem. Not a chance.

Customer service is a big thing for me. If your company is not willing to provide me with some sort of contact method, then you don't need and won't get my money. PERIOD!

I did what i was asked and now Uber is refusing to give me a refund of 12£ that i was charged.

She said i'm looking at it now. 4 weeks later, I get a notice. Your dispute has been resolved results merchant paid. I called my bag instead if you want to give your money away, give your money away, but you're not giving mine away. So back to Uber Eats. I used them the other night for order at McDonald's. My order came out to $17 and change. I left 15% tip. The girl was very nice. My food was hot and here in minutes. I gave her next $5 dollars cash. I noticed as I placed my order it said promotion has been deducted. And On my bank statement it cost me $30. What happened to my discount? Then try to get in touch with somebody.

Tip for consumers:
Their customer service seems to be coming from a call center from the country of India, the reps don't care about providing sensible customer service requests and often time they are hard to understand with their heavy foreign accents.

"Worst customer service experience, liars!
I placed an order which had buy one get one free promotion going on. Immediately after placing the order, I realized the promotion did not apply and I was overcharged. I called the restaurant and they said they cannot do anything. I contacted Uber eats support, who on chat asked for screenshots, and when provided, said price will be adjusted and I should wait. The charge finalized and price was not adjusted. I contacted them again, they told me they cannot do anything because I contacted them after 48 hours! I explained multiple times that I had contacted immediately and was told to wait and now I am being told that I should have contacted immediately. After getting same message again, the chat was ended by Uber. It is not about the miniscule charge of extra 10 dollars but a matter of principle, they are a money greedy company with shady customer service practices.

My son ordered via the app for McDonald’s via Uber but the rider was having difficulty finding the address. The rider didn’t speak English very well and kept hanging up. In the end it just appeared on the app that the order had been delivered when it hadn’t. I spoke to Uber on his behalf and they said they couldn’t process a refund even though I said I could provide CCTV footage to show it hadn’t arrived.

"I have been a loyal paying customer to Uber Eats for several years & they have been so unprofessional with their basic generic customer responses in my most recent order issue that I raised with them.I placed an order & there was a missing item so I raised it with them via their help chat within the app, I was then attacked for raising similar issues with previous orders (due to those restaurants making errors either missing / wrong / damaged items - that is not on me that’s on them for not doing their job properly! Also my current order issues have nothing to do with any previous order issues!)I was then told they wouldn’t refund the missing item because I have multiple duplicate accounts claiming promos for new customers which I have never done.Half the time their promos don’t apply to the restaurants I use!At this point the meal was already ruined because the fries were missing from the meal deal, I no longer care about the refund… I am now concerned that someone has created multiple accounts in my name & why have I never been notified of this until now when I have been a loyal paying customer for several years?!They’re happy to take my money with additional service & delivery fees on top which I don’t mind paying if they actually deliver what I ordered!I only have one Uber Eats account in my name, email address, home address, phone number & payment details so why are they allowing others to get away with creating multiple accounts in another person’s name then asking me to write to them with details of said duplicate accounts so they can delete them from the system?! I didn’t create them so how on earth can I email you details of them to delete them?! Absolutely ridiculous! This should’ve been raised initially when it occurred so they could close accounts fraudulently using another customer’s name / details!I even tried to speak with Uber UK Support on Twitter & they were just as useless giving generic robotic responses!They’re not even listening to the issues the customer is raising & now they seemingly no longer care about duplicate accounts they mentioned to me as they’re claiming their team has “resolved the issue”… NO THEY HAVE NOT!!!They didn’t refund the missing item & are not clarifying details about these so-called “multiple duplicate accounts” in my name.You can’t even contact them by phone to speak to someone who can listen & understand what the issues are to even begin resolving them! It’s so messed up… take your money & service elsewhere!You can’t blame customers for the failures of the restaurants who use your service, yes mistakes happen & things get forgotten or damaged etc (human error), but it happens too frequently with restaurants & Uber Eats don’t pull them up on it & instead attack their paying customers.They never used to be like this if there was an issue.If I was to dine in a restaurant & they messed up the order I would’ve obviously be refunded so when I order a takeout the restaurants / Uber Eats should do the same. Restaurants should be held accountable if they mess up an order that is paid for. Don’t blame the customer because staff aren’t doing their job properly. Disgusting unprofessional behaviour!Update:They replied 3 days later to apologise & as a “goodwill gesture” gave a full refund.I didn’t ask for a full refund, I only wanted a refund for the missing item I was reporting. It’s the principle of the matter. I guess due to the situation being handled so badly they decided to give a full refund which I appreciate.However, when I tried to enquire further about those so-called “multiple duplicate accounts” I just got generic responses again & no further details. I assume they made an error & I’m getting nowhere with their support team to find out if they actually exist or not.Overall it’s not a good experience & just made me worry if my personal details were being fraudulently used by others.","Date of experience: November 26, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,JD,Trust Pilot,,

"Refusal of refund after no delivery was madeUpdate: Uber Eats promised a refund. As soon as I'll have confirmation of it, I'll update again. As a sign for good will, the review is currently at 3 stars instead of the 1 star from before.Original review:I had ordered a Subway sandwich as I am heavily pregnant, was in a bit of pain and thus not feeling ok to cook. For some reason the website had changed my address so that the delivery driver was at the wrong house. We had a phone conversation for about 11 minutes where I also gave him the new address. He was adamant I come to the site to look for him even though I repeatedly told him I'm not ok for going outside as I was advised not to do so when not feeling ok. He then left my order on the street under the rain where he was. I ended up without dinner.When I contacted customer support, they now said that I'm not eligible for a refund. I find this not ok at all and it will be the last time I ordered (it was the second time in total). If the website had properly shown that the geo location was wrong, I would've corrected it but it didn't show up. If the delivery driver had bothered to type the new address in, everything would've been fine. If I had been physically able meet him at the site, I would have done so. But no. They rather want to keep my money for a service nor done than be kind to an expectant mother in physical pain a few days before the due date.I am disappointed.","Date of experience: December 12, 2023",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,LI,Trust Pilot,,

"I've been using Uber Eats for a while now and have not had any significant issues up until this point. I had been using the 3 month free trial, and decided to cancel the automatic renewal since it was nearing the end of the period. They gave me an offer of a $1 renewal for the next month as I was opting out, so I decided to accept. Big mistake. After checking my membership again, I noticed that I am still going to be billed the full $9.99 today DESPITE already paying $1 for the next month. The customer service is an absolute joke and simply asked why I wanted to cancel despite me already explaining before transferring (which apparently will now take 6-14 hours to address, it is very possible I will be billed again by the time this happens). On top of everything, they refuse to let you cancel a renewal 48 hours before it occurs. Why is this? Needless to say, I will never be using this service again.

"Traveling in Houston Friday, we used Uber Eats to deliver some Asian food. My wife tips $10 on the $76 check and hurried back to the room to see why the bill was so high.
The charge us $4 ea for two drinks that were not delivered. When my wife ordered three spring rolls nobody asked ""three orders?"" Or ""total of three?"" Nope, they didn't think it was odd for an order with only two entries to get 12 spring rolls, or they just were happier with increasing the amount of the sell. It's dishonest and wrong.
They also didn't think we'd maybe need a paper plate or plastic ware with our delivery location being a hotel? If it were my restaurant, my employees would be trained to ask things like: 'do you need plates, napkins and utensils?' Or 'each spring roll comes with a total of four, did you want 3, or 12?' Things like this are for the benefit of the customer. This joint did nothing like that. The Spicy Chen Asian Bistro will take advantage of you and send you food you don't need and short you on drinks your ordered. Then Uber Eats will REFUSE to credit your bill for the things you didn't receive! The representative is rude and arrogant. I will never consider using Uber Eats again and I warn you all about Spicy Chen Asian Bistro food is over the top salty and my chicken fried rice was awful. Many uncooked grains of rice and skinny little pieces of chicken that tasted more like eating a sun dried clam. It wasn't good and they do not care that the order was bad, after all we are only traveling, right? They don't know all my HS friends live nearby that hotel. They won't order from Spicy Chen Asian Bistro knowing that anything might, or might not, show up.
And to Jenn at Uber: a different line of work would be good for you because rude arrogant people are not helpful and make the situation worse that it already was. They actually damage the companies they work for. The lowest employees with such abundant arrogance? Hmmm. This is only 1 of 14 sites I am posting this review to. I made them a promise that I'd spread the news about this experience and she said go ahead, it won't matter to anybody. Order this duo at your own risk.
My son who is college out of state read my review and said ""Uber Eats never gets it right dad!"".
Tip for consumers:
Find another Asian Restaurant. If you do order expect hard chicken cooked until grainy and greasy limp cold food by the time they deliver. They guarantee food is on time or free deliveries for three months. They give selves 69 minutes to deliver!! How’re ever late. In addition the food is cold, but it’s “on time” according to Uber. Guarantees mean nothing if you change the definition to one that is nowhere near accepted definition for that service. Worst service and rude support.
Products used:
Chicken Fried Rice, General Chows Chicken 3 pieces (not orders) spring roll. Food was cold and limp from grease. We were given drinks we paid $9 for and idiot taking order for two entrees didn’t think to ask if we meant 3 spring rolls or 3 full orders? So they got $12 on spring rolls, $9 beverages and $9 tip that they didn’t earn. $30 is allot to me and they refuse to make it right.

"I don't use Uber because I have had issues previously with their Uber drivers, I know Uber don't care about anything but money.
My friend ordered Uber eats to my place on the weekend, and the driver delivered the food and then left, whether he actually left I am not sure about. 30 mins after the delivery was handed to me, the driver was back and buzzing my unit, I answered the intercom as i assuming he dropped something inside the complex and needed to come get it. He told me he needed to use the toilet and asked if I would let him use mine. I decided to do the right thing because Uber probably wouldn't care to ensure their drivers have bathroom access, they are reputable for being a poor employer and poor service, so I let him in to use my bathroom. When he came out of the bathroom, I expected he would than me and leave, but he wasn't leaving, he stayed near the door, looking around at my place. He seen my cat and started calling it over to which it ignored. Then he proceeded to ask me if I lived alone which made it clear he was not there because he needed to use the toilet. He couldn't see from where he was standing that I had a friend with me, but as soon as I told him another person was with me, he very quickly exited my unit without saying thanks or anything. This is extremely dodgy as he clearly didnt come to my home needing a bathroom, he either never left my complex and stayed for half an hour, or he left but then came back to target me because I am a young female and he thought i was alone. My friend contacted Uber via the app and told them what happened becuse we both felt very uncomfortable about what had happened, and Uber just sent a generic response to pretty much say sorry for the experience, and shut the conversation off. They are not looking into this incident and the driver can continue to try look for single women who live alone and try gain entry after deliveries. I already knew Uber would do nothing, it's typical Uber to not care.
I am wanting to warn everyone about using Uber that their drivers are untrustworthy and will try and target perople home alone and try gain access after the delivery is done. Do not trust Uber! They allow this to happen under their watch. Stay safe and avoid Uber, you cant trust your address with their drivers as you may be targeted. I have never had this issue with any other delivery app, it seems to be an issue with Ubers drivers, and probably because they let them get away with it and do nothing. I am now banning anybody from Using Uber at my home, apparently not using Uber myesf wasn't enough to avoid their problematic drivers.

"My husband thought it may be a good idea to order some food from Uber eats, McDonald's to be specific,to save me some time after work to not have to cook dinner. So he proceeded to order two quarter pounders with cheese and two large fries from McDonald's. Got the bill, the lady came and just handed him the order after trying to find where we were at, and handed him two bags of food. He asked her, ""why you handing me two bags"" because well this is your order she said. This is not our order she said yes it is and left. My husband decided that he was going to go in the house and try and call the number that was on the receipt on the package. Nobody would answer the phone. After several attempts, nobody would answer this phone. I got home and he told me what had happened and we're like what are we going to do with all this food? We don't eat hamburgers on a regular basis like this. So we decided that maybe they would come back for it once they realized what had happened. So we're sitting here waiting for the people to maybe call us back. Haven't heard anything from anyone yet and this is Wednesday this started Tuesday night. So I wake up Wednesday morning and I check my balance for my card and stuff and I have a charge of $88.95 on my card from Uber eats! Now how in the hell are you going to charge me for a mistake that you did, you would not rectify? You wouldn't even call back! You had our number! This is the first and THE VERY LAST TIME that we will EVEN EVER CONSIDER using Uber eats again! This was so wrong it was stupid! They should really get rid of Uber eats! It is worthless!
Tip for consumers:
Do not ever use Uber eats unless you want to lose your money!!

"Uber Eats started out good, but stops giving discount codes for most-used services. For example, I only get convenience or grocery offers now, rather than the restaurant offers that I use most. I think it's time to cancel Uber One and go with just the Dash Pass. Shame, too. We used it a lot. It says a lot about a company when they stop rewarding their regular customers with offers they'll actually use.

"Normally I'm ok using the app to contact customer service, but not when I have an issue that requires immediate assistance. Not offering a phone support line is cheap, unethical, and very lazy on Uber's part (there is a number if you search the net wide... and I mean wide, but it's an answering service that instructs you to use the app then hangs up on you). Email - no reply also. Crucial components of my order were missing. Not sure if I'll be getting a refund, hours later still waiting to hear back from their not so helpful app ""support"". Very UNenjoyable meals, lacking the very thing that makes them, and no way to get help on the spot when I needed it. Instead, left to source food elsewhere or eat substandard, full-priced meals, whilst feeling ripped off without suitable recourse.

Horrible customer service Waited near to an hour for an order that was made within the first 10 mins and had a driver cancel and but still did not re make my order .

I then chase this up again to find out they have a 2 day no refund . How is that logical if you did nothing about my order ?

"You keep sending me offers for 50% off my food delivery. It's a nice gesture, but my experience has been ridiculously bad. Every time I receive these offers I try to order and every time there are virtually no drivers available for any of the restaurants that I want to order from. If you don't have any drivers available for food delivery, why do you offer the discount or the service? Every other delivery service in the Portland Maine market, and there are many, are capable of picking up food at the restaurant of my choice and deliver it to my door in a reasonable amount of time. Why can't you? It has been so disappointing and infuriating that I have deleted your food app from my phone and I delete the offers as soon as they land in my inbox. I'm curious, do you actually consider this to be good customer service? For me it's terrible customer service and just makes me angry and frustrated.

"Extortion by requiring you pay extra for ""priority""or else they will bundle you with other orders with no consideration for the customer.

I am sick of the drivers lying they are at my flat when I'm at the door with broken ankle and crutches and they are not . They are argue that where they are is where Google has sent them . Today the delivery guy arguing he is there when I'm there at open door and he is not .I have to hop out of the door on crutches into the courtyard . Try and kneel up steps to shout him as God knows where he is . He finally came to gate arrogant and argumentative.  Realised he could lie anymore about being at my door .

Please judge if Starbucks charge $5.24 plus tax for a small americano and forgot to add cream which I requested? I feedback and complained, was I wrong? The other day I ordered one order of choco croissants (with 2 generous portion as per starbucks menu description) but I received only one piece. I complained and the reply was only one piece. Later the tech support encourged me to contact restaurant for more accurate information. Then why do we need to so much extry for UberEat, they can close their busness? I just received an email from Ubereat saying I complain more often than other customers and they may discontinue my service. Who's fault is this? When we had no more pandemnic threat, I wish ubereat and all delivery app will fade out and their business won't survive because this service is not human and terrible customer service. Remember, I had no problem in payment more expensive meals from ubereat but I want above standard service and support.

"This company is so unspeakably dog feaces that I have had to change this numerous times, so I will adjust this for brevity so it can maybe be of some use to anyone who stumbles across it.Before I try to briefly break down the steps I have experienced, here is the takeaway, this company is so bad that they stopped monitoring their complaints email address, removed a complaints section from their website and they have trained ( for lack of a better word) their staff to hangup/disconnect the live chat if you ask about a complaint procedure which literally violates governmental regulations put in place to ensure minimum standards for post-sales support 1: I attempted to place a small order using guest check out as I did not have an account2: I got to the check out stage, approved the payment via my bank app, for some reason uber declined the transaction on their end.3: I tried again, benefit of the doubt, figured maybe it was a one off website hiccup, this time I get a message saying I am not allowed to place the order as my card is associated with another account, a blatant lie, the first of many4: I went to the wrongly titled ""help"" section where it turns out all they do is tell you to create an account, an account is mandatory to even be allowed to try and talk to anyone5: I bite the bullet and create an account6: I talk to ""support"" staff who say "" I can see that your concern is not related to this account. Kindly write to us from the concerned account"", absolute lobtomites. You create an account to talk to them and they tell you they can't talk to you about that account. Genius training the ""support"" workers get clearly7: When you try to explain what your problem is about, that you do not have another account they say ""I am directing you towards the relevant team and they will be addressing your concern accordingly"". What this actually means is, ""I am too stupid, with too little training to be of any use whatsoever so I am disconnecting the chat now""8: Given the above I have tried to file a complaint which is impossible. The only email address I could find generates an automated reply saying it is unmonitored, there are no details on their website on how to file a complaint, the phone numbers floating around are evidently also unmanned.It's a joke. More expensive than any other service of its kind, more fee's than any other service of its kind, worst support literally ever to have existed, I could go and visit a comatose patient and there would be more brain activity and I would be more likely to get help than wading through the idiocy that is the entirety of ubereats ""support""","Date of experience: September 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,J.,Trust Pilot,,

"I ordered groceries this morning from Uber Eats because I had 40% off promo code. Minimum order was 70$ so I made an order just over 71$.
While the driver was shopping, the promo suddenly disappeared from basket. I couldn't rise concern as I wasn't billed yet. After the purchase was done the promo never applied and it was also gone from my promotions as I had technically used it.
After I received the delivery I turned to help section. They admitted that there was issue with the backend. BUT as I couldn't provide the promo code screenshot they refused to refund me. So I paid full price and got treated like a moron for NOT providing a picture.
So I consider Uber Eats a scam. Why would I as customer screenshot my promo code each time in fear of being ripped off?! This is nonsense. Especially because customer service already admitted mistake on their end.
After disagreeing with the rip off decision I just entered endless loop of automatic response of no screenshot no help.
And I pay for Uber One. Which I deeply regret now.
So yeah, steer clear from discount codes as they are a joke and you as a paying customer are too a joke to them. Garbage company and garbage customer service.

"I ordered a fast food meal from Uber eats and then realized I had it going to the wrong address. I cancelled the order within a minute or 2 and they still charged me $59.00 because they claim the order was already being prepared. A rediculous claim considering it was a fast food establishment that does not collect to order and the time between order and cancellation was far to short for that process to start

I contacted customer service with all of this information, and even provided a picture of my own with my address in view,  only to be told “I wasn’t eligible fore a refund” because their systems indicate the dirver reached the delivery point. Finally after questioning the logic and reason and the fact that the delivery person’s photo proves they did not come here, they granted my refund “as a one tike exception”.

My dessert was not in bag, hence 1st email. Then I realized although my salad was in bag the dressing was not the one I ordered so I messaged again, as I dont want dry salad. Regardless u can't reply to emails they send. They say via their app customer support will get back to you within 24hrs, LIES it has been over 84 hours now. No response! They have my info, they have my # they could have called or the restaurant could have to say would you like a different dessert if they were out / or chose to simply not bother to give me my pie. At same time they could have asked me to choose a different dressing if they did not have one I asked for! Is it Ubereats or the restaurant to blame? You tell me? They have agreed to work together I say they are equally to blame but moreso Ubereats as they are the ones I paid. At the end of the day I have a rotton salad that i paid for & a pie that I paid for that I did not receive. Again principle its not the 2.86 (salad) 1.29 (pie) 2.08 (tip they had no right forwarding in regards to my note that I WOULD TIP DRIVER MYSELF AND DID). Ahmad was a nice guy! It is that I do not and should not be charged for their screw ups (meaning Ubereats as they r the ones that took my $) They are the ones that have not got back to me that I am aware of. I dont mind the jacked up prices and delivery fees PROVIDING THEY GIVE ME WHAT I PAYED FOR!
Really choked at this company I will not be using their services again! Nor do I recommend anyone else go through the hassle that I did & still am!
My summary of gatger thoughts as follows...
- TOTALLY Disrespectful %!
- NOT Courteous!
- TAKE $ THEY DIDN'T EARN!
~ABSOLUTELY NON RESPONSIVE TO YOUR COMMENTS, COMMUNICATION, EMAILS, MESSAGE ATTEMPTS

I HIGHLY DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS SERVICE TO ANYBODY! SCREENSHOT Shows them thanking me for tip I did NOT authorize! To me that is stealing! NOT HAPPY %%%%%%

"This past weekend was the first time I used Uber Eats and I'm glad I did.  Placed my order using the app, and my order was delivered sooner than the time the app said it would be delivered.  The food was hot and fresh!","Date of experience: November 11, 2023",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VS,Trust Pilot,,
Past 2 weeks has been very unprofessional with your drivers ran away with my order they said I receive but I did not again they left my drinks 2 combos uber eats stating they can't do anything about why ask customer question about there order if you not going to compensate their mistakes yes I did receive a refund on the order I didn't receive but 2nd incident they forgot my drinks for 2 combo nearly 8.00 pot pie just 3.65 so I lost a 15.00 profit my meal was 25.00 plus tip 5.00 30.00 wasted..,"January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tonya Mason,Google Play Store,,
"Their refund policy is very inconsistent, which I learned to tolerate but today I received an email offering $5 credit in exchange for doing a survey. Approx 15 mins later I finally complete the survey after which point it states ""Sorry, you are not eligible for this survey"" ... Why not? You lied and wasted my time. Getting better service from their competition lately for a couple of reasons. Won't be reactivating Uber One after all.","October 6, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandon Die-kasten,Google Play Store,,
"I ordered chick fil a from Uber eats. Ice brew, 12 ct nugget and large fruit. Driver walks in drink and bag. Bag had my receipt printed by chick fil a in the outside. Driver leaves no fruit in the bag although receipt says what I ordered. Called Uber eats they said nothing they can do. I don't qualify for a refund. Call chick fil a manager says yes man your fruit is sitting here driver didn't pick it up. Manager proceeds to say we don't pack cold food with hot food. So Uber blocked me from a refund but I didn't get my food. Chick fil a manager says they have a notebook filled with food left by Uber. That's disturbing. Uber eats took my money didn't deliver my food and I payed $10 for large fruit I never received. What the hell. Time for a class action law suit against Uber eats. Anyone else have these issues. I'm going to post on all social media for a class action law suit.

"After ordering from McDelivery App in April and having lots of missing items, I phoned the restaurant and was told it was UberEats issue and they couldn’t do anything. Money wasted. Today (October) we decided to try again. A missing item again. Tried to phone UberEats they just said that they couldn’t find my details and pretty much were going to hang up and told me to ring back when I had the right details. I said I had ordered off the app and tried again. Same ineffective and rude response. They had no intention of solving this issue. If I went into a shop and didn’t pay for an item I would be a criminal. However, these companies are charging me for items that they do not deliver and then make it impossible to claim back. Won’t be ordering a McDelivery again or Uber eats.","Date of experience: October 03, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,WI,Trust Pilot,,

"Don’t bother. We won’t be using Uber Eats again. At least not for our local Pizza Express (Muswell Hill). Hard to tell who’s really at fault but neither side knows what the other is doing. We waited 2 hours for one pizza for my daughter; Uber Eats have no customer service to speak of, of course. The app just takes you round in circles, getting nowhere except to the same unhelpful generic pages. At the 2 hour point, we drive to Pizza Express, where they looked up the order on their system and it showed the pizza had been picked up by Uber Eats, even though our app was still saying waiting for pick up, and moving the estimated time on by 10 mins every 10 mins. The Pizza Express people said they get problems every night with Uber Eats where drivers don’t bother to wait (or can’t, due to parking restrictions) so no one picks up the order; or it gets picked up but doesn’t make it to the customer. In the end we managed to cancel our order and Pizza Express made my daughter a fresh pizza, which took about one minute, and we were out of there, vowing to not bother with Uber Eats ever again. If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn’t have written this review, but the exact same thing happened last time we ordered from the same Pizza Express - also a 2 hour wait, also ended up with us picking up the pizza ourselves. So, like I say: never again.","Date of experience: September 08, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SB,Trust Pilot,,
"Not impressed. Food ordered 4 hours in advance arrived over 2 hours out of the time slot. Spent all that time trying to reach the restaurant on the phone, who were permanently engaged, for an indication of the expected delivery time. Ended up cooking our own food as it was so late.Since then I have tried to raise a dispute with Uber but am being sent away as it appears late delivery is not important to discuss.Won't be using again.","Date of experience: December 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,BE,Trust Pilot,,

"My mother placed an order for 152.89 cents through Uber eats and canceled as delivery times were unsatisfactory, app shows cancelled so my mom thought it's done. She ordered some place else. 2 days later she sees two charges on credit card statements, called Uber eats, they blame my mother for not calling earlier, neither did they send any receipt, for my mom to know she was charged. Bottom line very poor customer service, not willing to listen and satisfy a customer. Unless, we consumers start using alternatives do these companies realize, customer satisfaction is of upmost importance and profits come secondary…, after this experience our family and friends are boycotting Uber eats! Hope you all will after this horrible experience with a senior citizen. Unfairly charged

"Can't live without this service!Great options, super transparent. I think the commission with providers is a little rich and a scaling model based on turnover would be a more suitable approach. Some drivers don't store the food in the warming containers which is a little frustrating at times because soggy tacos is no fun for anyone! Other than that.. This is a service the world needs!",2020-05-15T06:45:34.000Z,3,Josh W.,productreview,,Can't live without this service!
"Uber eats customer service are unprofessional. They charged me a meal that showed on their system as £25, then later the amount changed to £31.20 but they took out from my account £37.20. I'm trying to get a refund but I'm seem to be going round in circles. They don't even read your messages properly. Terrible customer service not going to be using them again.","Date of experience: September 26, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AB,Trust Pilot,,

"The ""encouragement"" (basically forcing drivers to take on too many orders) causes food wait times of over a hour and cold food unless you pay even more for ""priority"". Just make your own food.","December 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,J B,Google Play Store,,
Stop asking if I want discounts or to sign up for your subscriptions. I do not want to be asked a second time. I most certainly don't want to be asked every time I open the app.,"December 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel Scott,Google Play Store,,
I order from subway they didn't have what I order but still took the order and now I don't have food or my money can't talk to a real person so I didn't get nothing. No customer service on both ends.,"January 23rd, 2024",1,T K.,sitejabber,,
Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store,,
Most terrible experience waited 2 hours for delivery couldn't get any one on the phone wouldn't refund.

UPDATE 9/2 The last 3 times I've ordered there's been some issue. and the Uber cash policy is 💩 they say it was used for the order you received it for ??!! utter nonsense. you're still charged the same. not using the app anymore. cheap delivery fees aren't worth the extra wait, aggravation, or ""support""","September 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Morris,Google Play Store,,
