"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification. I order the same things but they never look the same or miss items more and more, the quality of food is definitely decreasing while the prices keep rising.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sahra O,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants. After years of being a loyal customer, it still doesn't get what I like and don't! Too expensive for absolutely no reason.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ishak Al Khatib,Google Play Store
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store
"Search function is awful. You search for certain menu items and they show you places that don't have the item on their menu. The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails. They're incredibly stingy with promo codes and they need to lower the minimum requirement to $20 instead of $25 for the 50% off. Oh, and I have no pets; stop offering me pet food coupons!","January 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Z M,Google Play Store
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour. By the time I was able to contact support, it had already arrived luke warm.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel L,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store
"I placed a takeaway order on UberEats and the status page showed that I can add items from grocery stores for no delivery fee. I decided to give that a go and added some items from Co-Op. When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost £7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store
"Horrible I had an uber 1, trial & when it came time to cancel. I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to. And that was days after the trial period was over and was expected to pay for the subscription, I never used the benefits of the subscription 1 single time.","January 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,james Linge,Google Play Store
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store
"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store
It user to be Easy to use. Very useful. But now if you have issue such as items missing or the restaurant not following orders which means the food goes to waste along with the money. Honestly annoyed with the changes. And any time you go to support about it they don't want to hear and brush you off saying nothing can be done.,"January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KittyCatNyx,Google Play Store
"Overpriced and misleading app. Got an email that said "" get 60% off your order as a welcome back"" so I decided to order for once. Clicked the email link, it opened the app, took me to the restaraunts that accepted this offer. I get to checkout and the discount does not apply. Spent 20 minutes trying to find a way to apply the discount, but there was no where in the options for it. Following that, the order was incorrect and cold. Unacceptable. Uber died and its corpse delivers disappointment","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Zane Elliott,Google Play Store
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store
"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store
"Update: bug has been fixed. On another note, to uber eats drivers. Stop leaving the food in front of doors. The majority of front doors open outwards. Meaning that food gets ruined or can't be access easily because it is blocking the door's ability to open. ~ App seems to have a bug. When I click on an item the screen goes blank and I can't order any food.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12. It's basically for ""emergencies"" when you're in a city overnight for a layover, but that's about it. But otherwise, love it!","November 17, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lisa Coester,Google Play Store
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini. What a scam!","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,anthonio j,Google Play Store
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available 😒. I got charged over £6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available. I'm an Uber one customer, but I'm really thinking of deleting the app. Total rip-off money in delivery fees. There is no option to talk to a human being so frustrating.","December 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Nikolay Ivanov,Google Play Store
Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes. The blue dot of my actual location is in the right place. Tired of having to walk 500m to find my food sitting in someone elses driveway. I've provided feedback in the app.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Craig Galbraith,Google Play Store
"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange! Fix it","November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel C,Google Play Store
"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store
"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store
"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3. Certain restaurants get un-favorited every day for some reason. Even after adding back they don't appear in my faves.","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jeremy B,Google Play Store
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store
"Edit: Issue was fixed, updating from 2 to 5. Original: How can I submit this to a developer? For the past few days the app has not been functioning properly. When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart. Based on recent reviews in the Play Store, it seems others are having a similar issue. I've tried many work arounds, and end up having to order from my laptop or not order at all.","November 7, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,M L,Google Play Store
"Terrible Customer Service. I reached out for assistance with my account. I stopped receiving promotions and all the promo codes experienced errors and would not apply. I was sent one email and then the rest of my requests were ignored. ""According to the Terms and Conditions, Uber reserves the right to disable promo codes/marketing campaigns. You can still continue to order from the app."" This is not customer service. I requested a full refund for my membership fee and received no response. Bad!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Watson,Google Play Store
"Ordered from the app. Did not receive two of the items. Getting a refund via the app resulted in a paltry refund for less than half the missing items. Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I wish I can post a picture of you can see how much they charge you for a $20 meal it is $7.98 for fees, this has nothing to do with the delivery, which is an additional $1.89! There is absolutely no way you're going to be able to tip the delivery guy with the amount of fees they're charging to! I don't stop using the app, but I absolutely do not tip anymore! You can get your tip from that $10 that charging me for the service! Everybody should feel the same way!

"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store
"One of the worst food delivery apps. My first order after Uber One got delayed by 25 mins from the latest delivery time. Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"". Finally asked them to cancel my Uber One subscription, they closed the chat saying we cannot do anything. Best Cold food service.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Siddharth Sarangi,Google Play Store
An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery. I also feel that if you are subscribed to Uber one priority delivery should be either free or at a reduced price. The fees are high enough as it is.,"December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martin Patey,Google Play Store
"It's expensive , you're paying at least like 10-12 mote bucks than if you bought it at the actual restaurant. Uber one saves money but not much. They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience. My biggest issue is simply the over the top fees even with uber one.","December 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ration,Google Play Store
"App is easy to use. An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund. I lost 48$ I hope door dash doesn't do this nonsense.","January 14, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,kikyo jewel,Google Play Store

I alos paid almost twice the food price for a chicken sandwich because of two sets of fees, taxes and (lowest option) tip. A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

Customer service has told me there's an issue with my account, that they've bumped it to their tech team, and that I should retroactively contact customer service to get my delivery fee refunded after each order.

However, I've noticed a shift towards a more corporate approach. Tipping persistence is just one of those.

"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me.

"Uber Eats started out good, but stops giving discount codes for most-used services. For example, I only get convenience or grocery offers now, rather than the restaurant offers that I use most. I think it's time to cancel Uber One and go with just the Dash Pass. Shame, too. We used it a lot. It says a lot about a company when they stop rewarding their regular customers with offers they'll actually use. Door Dash doesn't do that, so I think I'll go with them.","November 27, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Michelle Jones,Google Play Store
"You pay so much money just to order food, and that's not considering tip. Why is the delivery fee $10, I'm paying an additional $10, and it's not tip? I've just had it. It makes more sense to order directly from a restaurant and pay cash and tip, without the ridiculous additional fees. It's so expensive and it's just not worth it.

Worse delivery app and service ever coming from someone who has used it for years. Despite having multiple issues the only help you'll ever receive is from automated responses that didn't even read your message or address it before closing it.

It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived?

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet.

UberOne was great now barely gives discounted fees or offers so pretty much useless.","December 21, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Cadoret,Google Play Store
"Stopped using it as a bug in the app placed a double order. The error didn't show up at the checkout and only became apparent as soon as I received my food. I immediately contacted customer support upon receiving my order to explain. After days of waiting they denied me a refund without explanation or rationale. Despite my previous order history of ordering the exact same items from the same place, they were not interested in investigating the app error. I've lost my trust in Uber Eats","November 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Smith,Google Play Store
"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

Finally got delivered cold and unsafe to eat at 8.55 because the restaurant had already made it. This was with a 10% tip and priority. I would cancel the tip but the driver that ended up delivering it doesn't deserve that. I've also been delivered the wrong thing on three occasions. I sent proof but have never been refunded.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nate Marsh,Google Play Store

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item. So it's just not fair for them to rebuke our right to refund just because we requested it in past orders.","November 13, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jadeyeyeyeyey,Google Play Store

All they were able to say is 'sorry, no refund' !

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

My card keeps coming up as low balance even though i have $169 and i can't ask for help because it's not on the help list at all.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself. Was then blocked from asking follow up questions about this ""order"" that I paid for but never received. Very disappointed all around.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Megan McCormick,Google Play Store
"Lazy drivers and dishonest business practice. I had signed up for Uber One and decided on paying the $9.99 monthly membership, only to find out that it had somehow been changed to the annual $99.99 membership without my permission. Then, to make things worse when I tried to delete my account, I was told there's a back balance due for an amount I was supposed to be refunded. Based on principle alone, I'm never using this app again.","December 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Gonzales,Google Play Store
"Had a really poor experience and had no way to resolve it with customer service. Gave instructions to leave the order at a specific location. Driver called me to ask if I was there, so I walked down to confirm and he was not. 5 minutes later, I get a notification and picture saying it's been delivered... somewhere else. Called the driver, they responded saying they went where instructed and mentioned the wrong address. Contacted support and they said ""sorry"". Not acceptable service.","December 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Greg Kraska,Google Play Store
Uber Eats app is utterly disorganized and user unfriendly. It's geared for max profit to UE regardless of customer satisfaction. Help is not easily accessible which is unfair business practice.

So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie Negrõn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order.

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra £3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the £5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

"Fees and pricing is absolutely insane. A 5 dollar meal costs around 20 dollars, not including tip. Service fees are literally as much as the items I'm ordering, doubling the cost of items that are already raised from the original pricing at the restaurant. Highly don't recommend unless last resort with no other option.","November 15, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jared Bauman,Google Play Store
The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account. You can not contact Uber to tell them that you have lost your credit card and need to give them the updated details because you need your old details to even be able to contact them. How bizarre!,"November 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shane Johnson,Google Play Store
"Food was delivered. But the next time I opened the app, (3 weeks later) it asked me to give a tip, I said no for that order. It glitched and said I gave a £8+ tip. Great.

"Discounts mean basically nothing. 20% discounts up to $20 means you have to spend more than $50 to get the full $20 off. Feels slimy. Not to mention the poor customer service at times.

I've sent screenshots of the issue, they said they can retrospectivly apply the voucher but I'm waiting 3hours to 17 hours for a reply. This is the worst service! It is good, wish it was cheaper tho.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless.

Requested a refund, and got previous refunds for much less hassle, and didn't get it! Very poor customer service overall from that experience.

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

"Supervisor Jude instructed me to reinstall the app in order to fix a restaurant's improperly entered menu. Problem exists on your end, not mine, duh. So, if I want to order food that's listed and get the appropriate price, I can't use this app on my phone, tablet or website since the menu itself is incorrect. This has gone unresolved for about 2 months.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Their support is a joke. I had an issue with the app sending in an incorrect order and the customer service rep told me if I accept delivery of the order I can reference the conversation and get a refund. I followed those steps and Uber has refused my refund and I am unable to open a support ticket with a person to resolve this. There was one opened however the rep closed it out without my permission or everything being made right.

I'm editing my previous 1 star review by saying I wish I could make it Negative 1 Star for the fact that they also charge you more than the store for the food on top of charging you heavily for delivery and service fees.

If you don't set your delivery address before you order,if you order from different locations,and it goes to the wrong address they will not correct it only giving you a 50% discount.

"Ordered last time a dinner for the 2 of us, paid express delivery, in total about 80 euros. The food should have arrived in 35 min but it took almost 1 and half hours. By looking at the map either the driver got lost on the way, as he made several diversions, or he had another delivery on the way (I paid for express delivery). Food arrived cold and beer warm.

Uber Eats offers coupons and promos (unlike DD) and every experience for no contact drop off is done quickly, efficiently, and without any hassle. The app is smooth & has a nice user experience. Thus far, Uber One is well worth it, but we'll see. There are still significantly less restaurants/stores on Uber Eats vs DD in my area, but if they keep expanding, I'll switch permanently.

Here are some tips when using Uber Eats: 1) You have 10 minutes after you place your order to add an additional order at another restaurant while your primary (first) order is being prepared.

But be sure to track the orders, and if the same driver is making both deliveries. 2) When rating your order and driver be sure NOT to tip unless you want to give the driver more than what you originally agreed.","December 12, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,E.

Great! Great app. Overall they do some things right. They do some things wrong. I think they need to do a lot more background checks on some other people. I have had my food stolen and one of the drivers flick me off when I open my door to get my food and drove off on me but they were really good on responding back with me the support team and giving me my money back and credit and extra credit so I give them props on that.

Bad customer service. They have a lifetime refund limit and will just stop refunding missing or cancelled orders. I was charged twice for 1 order and they refuse to refund me. It just feels illegal. The customer service only makes matters worse and almost try to guilt trip you. I've used uber eats for years and I actively avoid reviewing things.

"Misleading information regarding arrivals. When choosing a restaurant with, for example, 20 minutes of estimate arrival, it takes as much as twice or the triple of the time (40 to 60 minutes) When the courier is heading its way to deliver the food, regardless of having other stops, the ""latest arrival"" is constantly updating to a longer time.

Uber eats have become the worst. You cannot even get decent support when your order is delayed so much that you can see it is not coming. Orders change status to complete when nothing has arrived and you have to fight to get refunds even after they tell you it has been refunded. Right now my order has been delayed way past closing time of the restaurant. The driver is not responsive and there is no support on the app. This is my second order in the space of less than a month like this.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chandini Wentzel,Google Play Store

I tried reaching out to the driver and they kept hanging up on me. I called customer service and they said it shows delivered and couldn't issue a refund. I kept telling them that it does show delivered but the house on the photo is not my house. They kept saying it shows delivered and there's nothing they can do.

My go to food delivery app. I like being able to modify tips as I have had bad experiences with other delivery apps where you can't. They are good at refunding incorrect orders as long as you include proof that the order doesn't match and it's quick to respond. I actually pay for the subscription since I use this so much.

Instead, they use the majority of it to tip the driver you already tipped, and then only giving you whats left over, claiming you did really get the full refund.

Uber eats is very convenient if you have any problems customer service is willing to help. I've had a few issues here and there but it's not that big of an issue.

I ordered food from the app. One of the items didn't arrive. I told Uber about this and the only thing they sent me was a boilerplate answer saying that I couldn't be refunded.

Generally very convenient. Sometimes food is left uncollected from the restaurant for over half an hour and this makes it inedible by the time it gets to my door - usually the complaints department is relatively reasonable...

A chat window came up to discuss and the person on the other end didn't respond at all and that was over 20 min ago.

Customer service have gone downhill. Its like they don't care anymore. I have ordered a lot from here & when there are problems I report it & they would ask for proof and refund. I've been using the app for over 5 yrs & now all I get is a message saying that my account has had a lot of refunds/ adjustments so now I don't get anything. I have emailed them with numerous photos as proof & nothing. They make it out like they can't trust me even with proof. I've had enough now.

I absolutely hate this service!! Cancelling everything I have associated by them. 5th time in a row something has been cancelled now ruined 3 meals and 2 dates. I will say they are great if you order something that's not really that important because they are not reliable nor communicative.

Once you click on it in your email and accept it, whatever email it's assigned to, it's there for good. I just feel bad for the people who spent money to give me a gift card.

But slowly slowly over time it started changing as it gained customers, and no longer had the need to offer good and fair customer service. Be prepared to wait for your order and have no recourses as the wait time is presented to you as an estimate and therefore waiting time can easily exceed 90 minutes.

Orders frequently cancelled without any explanation (usually after waiting 20-30+ minutes). Uber Eats then cunningly 'deletes' the order from ever even being processed so that you cannot inquire about it via their app (need to refer to a past order to be able to seek 'help'). Genius level avoidance of customers. Food often missing from orders and restaurants deny blame. Delivered to wrong house frequently (mine is numbered and well lit). Terrible. 1 star.,"November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jay Best,Google Play Store

So far so good no taking of the food and not delivering anymore because of the GPS and Uber allow everyone to take pictures to secure their jobs. I use to work door dash and I delivered donuts to a customer and took a picture and all and got blocked from the app and wasn't paid. After that I said to myself time to get a real full time job.

They don't even deserve 1 star nor do they deserve to be operational.","November 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vinice Pillay,Google Play Store
Beware when you order through Uber they have drivers that can't read or speak English on top of that uber at times will take your money and won't give you what you paid for. I just had that happen to me I ordered dish liquid and got pods that I didn't need. I used uber because I have the flu and didn't want to leave my place. When I contact uber they said my order wasn't eligible for refund or what I ordered so I'm just out of my money.

Unsafe and inconvenient. The maps has been incorrect for years now and it puts the drivers on the other side of the highway instead of at my address. The app also does not give me the option to deny bicycle delivery. I live by a highway and it is a major safety issue for people to bike here.

At this point I'm not saving any money if I have to order more to justify the savings.

"I have been using this app for some time now, and a few things have changed in the last year that have made me change my review to 1 star. The first thing is the price hike. I'm not sure how a $40 order turns in a $75 order before tip without me adding anything to my basket. The second thing is the fact that for the last 3 months, I have not received a correct order. The orders are either missing multiple items, completely wrong, or dropped off at the wrong house.","December 31, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Austin CRAIG,Google Play Store

The overall quality that you get from the restaurants has sharply declined over the last year. The app itself has become extremely glitchy in that if you use the reorder function make sure that you read your order very carefully before you submit. Sometimes it has a tendency to duplicate orders. Their customer service has significantly gone downhill making it almost impossible to contact anybody when there is an issue with the food that has been delivered.,"September 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ed Miller,Google Play Store
Uber Eats adda fees and such for themselves and the restaurants. The issue is they are also adding almost 30% to each menu item itself without telling you. The restaurant may charge $11 for an item but Uber Eats says the item is $15 when it is not. I feel this is a violation of the DTPA. It is highly deceptive.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terry Sangster,Google Play Store

Paid for the express delivery 30 min, app showed food being prepared on time Delivery took for ages food stone cold. Issue reported on the day. Took them 4days to look at all issues and it's now our fault for not reporting the issue in 48 hrs so no refund. Never again not worth the risk.

I often click the button to order, see the order get acknowledged, then switch focus to another app, theb come back 30mins later wondering where my order went. It just disappears into the ether.

Someone else had to which caused it to be late, but I don't think it's right to give them a bad rating or take their tip away for the other person not following through, so I requested that that person not be allowed to accept my order anymore due to the issue that arises.

When you request replacement items rather than an automatic refund they accuse you of abusing them and use that as justification to end the call, it's just a shame none of the employees realise calls are recorded.

Every time we have an issue with Uber Eats the refund and inconvenience has never been equivalent to the amount needed to make it right. This has happened on several occasions but in this instance (which is the reason I deleted the app and will not use them again) is that we ordered a $15.00 combo from a fast food restaurant and the combo was missing an item.

"Awful. Customer service is very helpful, but there's only so much they can do in the face of a company like this. Despite being a subscriber for many months, every one of my past few orders have incorrect/missing items.

The problem: we still needed food for the kids. I reordered ONE of the missing items and with fees and tip, I had to pay $6 more than what I was credited for the two missing items. So, I ended up paying more money for less food than I originally ordered. Uber refuses to make it right.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lisa Hare,Google Play Store

Uber service is not the best anymore. There are so many issues especially with the delivery. The driver keeps on changing.

"The app is great, but you guys need to do a better job of prioritizing restaurants based on delivery addresses. If I order from a restaurant chain that has one location 5 miles away, and another 15, it would make sense to flag the 5 mile one first, since the app auto selects the location when setting an order. Maybe this is your way of getting a few extra dollars off us (seeing how you will charge us for the price when canceling or more to pay, due to distance), but let's be fair about this.","August 11, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Matt Gray,Google Play Store

Amazon considers one time exception and transfers chat/call when asked for supervisor but not Uber. Thank you for your amazing One membership. Edit - Changed rating (1 to 3) as help arrived.

"The interface to order something from a second location to be added to your order works so badly and is so frustrating it is basically not worth even trying to use. The number of times it resets to the first store while I'm trying to scroll through is ridiculous, and there doesn't seem to be a way to search for an item and then pick a store that sells it. Very badly implemented.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jayson Kent,Google Play Store
"First off, the fact that the only coupons I ever get anymore are for ""groceries"" is useless. I never use them, stop giving them to me. Secondly, having no option to request utensils or add notes to an order for many places. This results in multiple times where I get no straw or utensils for something that is too messy without them. The convenience is slowly starting to be outweighed by how useless the app actually is.","September 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reza CatThing,Google Play Store

"The promos are misleading af. '20% off' ends up being (no joke) 81p on a £21 bill with all the charges. Don't waste your time trying to get it to the minimum spend, just order what you want, it'll come out to less without the 'promo'. The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost. The drivers are great & doing their best, but of course Uber guilts you into tipping after all other charges, instead of just paying them enough.","August 25, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Siobhan H,Google Play Store
"Terrible customer service. It's not the first time that delivery person ""fakes"" being lost and not finding the address in order for the order to be cancelled. They take forever to deliver the order... make calls just to make it seem as they contacted the person...And the funny thing is there is no way the app allows a user to report that kind of suspicious action.

"Customer support is awful. Unless your issue is super basic and simple, it won't get solved. They don't care or trust their customers, when in doubt they will just ignore you and keep your money. I recommend using any other delivery app. The app has some bugs and glitches that get annoying in the long run.

That was after two requests for a different delivery person, being hung up on and telling me I can not cancel without being charged.

Almost every other time I try and use Uber eats I end up getting told that for some reason my order can't be delivered as soon as I go to pay.

So I go to cancel my order, and I'm informed they can't do that. 30 minutes of support chat later and they tell me they can cancel but they have to charge me for the driver's time.

Uber cash is a lie. You must dispute with your bank, and they will fix it. So, they wrongfully placed an outstanding balance on my UE account. They falsely claimed I had to pay to fix it. I did not, but they fixed it. I reached out to support. Now I can't complete orders.

I understand that fraud is probably rampant but it's super frustrating that 80 percent of our orders is missing an item or made incorrectly and they have a limit to how many times they will make something right for you.

I contacted them this time because I had cancelled an order and had not been refunded. They replied that I'd had to contact them to get a refund for an order I'd cancelled, so I hadn't received my order or my money.

My delivery person just stops in one place or goes the opposite direction of the actual restaurant. They then waste 10-15 minutes before ""opting out"" of the order as customer support called it.

I have to walk around the house to not flip my food over or smear it across the porch. There is so much space, and they always choose against the screen door. If there is a screen door, it must open out. If it went in, there would be a mess of doors, knobs and size issues.

App is very glitchy and drivers can do multiple order deliveries so food is always cold. When you have to deal with the customer service team you just get passed around from team to team while they try and figure out what's going on. Can't recommend the service.

Instead of investigating why restaurants are doing this, they blame the customer and refuse any solution. Also when you add a voucher to an order, remember they can remove the voucher at will.

Why should I keep using your app when you let your driver's sxam us and take our food and then don't allow us to get a refund? I didn't even get half my food and the app told me I wasn't eligible for a refund even though some of my recent orders had issues too. So I wastes money on getting half my order.

I really don't recommend to use its not like hot it used to be. They charge extra and will remove items and mess the whole order up. If they don't have a certain item they should replace it with something or it should be registered before it allows me to order which also resulted in me losing the promo code discount.

"Edit: Used it for the first time in the US, and the app was really struggling to work. The restaurant I wanted to order from said we were too far away for delivery, even though we were 3 miles away. The address next door to the restaurant even said it was too far to deliver. Then I entered an address FARTHER away, in another city, and the delivery was available. So I drove to go meet the driver bc we were using a promo for delivery only. Then taxes and fees still made dinner $20.

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers. I had a delivery driver steal my food and Uber (their only customer service is the in-app chat in which agents copy and paste the same responses word for word over and over again) refused to give me a refund. I had to file with my bank to issue a chargeback. Will be going to GrubHub. Never again.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sarah Gaestel,Google Play Store
Uber Eats is the least dependable delivery service available. They are never on time if they even show up with your order at all. If they do actually show up it's late and the order almost always consists of incorrect or missing items.

All that time the delivery was ""on it's way"" but in fact it was just pending and no one even started preparing it, untill the store was closed.

"Very scummy implementation of promotional offers. It advertises promotional offers to entice you to sign up or fill a basket for an order and then the promotions become unredeemable. Free trial emails that take you to a ""Try Now"" button where the small print says it'll charge you. Promotional offers that say all nearby stores or restaurants are ineligible when you try to actually apply them. Customer support that either don't read your messages or lack any reading comprehension. AVOID.Not worth.","September 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan “Boff” Knight,Google Play Store

Makes sure there are no restaurants in your area to use vouchers on after you use the 2 out of the 5 uses you have available. Customer service is only on twitter/X and they do not read messages properly and use copy paste replies.

I love they will still let me order food if I'm low on funds, and I can pay it back after I get a paycheck. Very easy to navigate, although support could use a tune.

"Only slightly better than Door Dash. The drivers still miss entire food items to be included and /or order notes. Sometimes it's not even the person or car listed.

Very expensive mind you, but it's better than Just Eat which has the habit of losing your orders (losing them completely ""accidentally"" into the mouths of the delivery drivers, hmm...) . With uber eats you can see where the driver is on the map the whole time, so they can't scarper off with your scran. I've never not had an order delivered, with Uber Eats.

I also could not find a customer service number for Uber Eats.

Until they do that, I cannot even use the app","September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kaely Mitchell,Google Play Store
"As for the service, quite expensive but generally reliable. Have had a couple drivers bail during delivery. Food usually arrives hot. As for the app, it's an incredible resource hog & causes itself to crash repeatedly (on a pixel 4 with Android 13) every time I'm trying to order.

"Pay for priority delivery and yet constantly given drivers who are sitting on car parks finishing lunch and given tracking that isn't accurate - which prevents me from meeting the driver downstairs, which has led to my food being stolen or left outside because there are no parks for the drivers.

"Overall, better than Skip. But I am still disappointed with customer service when they make a mistake. It is usually the driver's fault. Wrong orders from same restaurant delivered, and at least they gave a full refund. Would prefer I get my order right, or the proper one brought to me after the mistake, but that's asking too much from a big corporation. They get it right about 60-70% of the time though, so expect disappointment, and be happy with what you get when they make a mistake.😐","August 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Brad B,Google Play Store

Second of all, Uber Eats is trying to cheat us because when I ordered food from some restaurants and order was placed, there was a pop-up notification from uber app saying you will get a free delivery on your tim hortons order when you order within 7 minutes and Timer was clicking down so I order from tim hortons after delivery of both order when I see the receipt uber charge me 5.99 dollars for delivery fees.","August 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hardish Parikh,Google Play Store

I had even asked the drivers to contact me if they had issues. I paid priority and waited an 1 hour for a 20 min food pickup. The food was cold and I paid priority. They offered me a $5 in Uber cash and had paid $3 already for priority. I would like there customer service to improve.

If they don't know English they would not be able to read street numbers and addresses properly and most of all explain why they made a mistake. I am very disappointed at UE and will not be using it ever.","January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Agnes G,Google Play Store

Is this a joke? I keep getting notifications to try Uber Eats again so I got on the app to order breakfast from McDonald's. They are 1 mile away. The delivery fee was 19.99. WHAT? Every other restaurant that I usually order from is more of the same. I would like to have seen if they have improved their slow delivery times before being forced to join Uber One.

You are soo useless. Like literally the customer service is garbage. I can't find a customer service to speak. The driver I had today literally make me cancel the order so he fudging eat for free. So I have to pay the extra fees for wasting time the restaurant and the driver. I meant why. The driver was lying about not having the order and I have to order the food again.

Very convenient. Gives credit or refund with no difficulty whenever there's a mistake with an order. The photos make the menus easy to order from. Quick responses from customer service. Orders saved so you can easily see what you purchased previously before making a new order. Frequent updates on the status of an order. Lots of offers to save. Notifications when a restaurant is open to take orders.

Overall app is great but there is some points need to improve like most of the restaurants don't update their menu's sometimes when we order something it cancelled the order at the last minute saying some excuses it's better to update the menu before we order and wait until they cancelle order at the last moment. And if we order something and it's started raining we know it's dificult to deliver the order in that case we should have a option to contact with someone and took the deliver directly,"October 11, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Gihan Himasha,Google Play Store
"If you have an issue and need help with the past (non ongoing) order, it is impossible to get help. If you try to call to the customer service line, they would not answer and direct you back to the Uber Eats app, because you do not have an ongoing order. However, the app is useless as you cannot get through to the customer service team either. The options of the issue that you need to choose from are not the ones I am experiencing. In the end, you get stuck and cannot do anything about it.","September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Julius Semenas,Google Play Store

And they won't tell me why they just keep repeating a script that my order is ineligible for a refund.... I've spent so much money here in the past. I cancelled my membership.

"I pay to have uber one membership because how often I use it, the £5 a month is absolutely so worth it!! I mainly grocery shop from it because free delivery so obviously a much better option than order straight from the store. Plus you get it straight away! It's not often there are problems but when there have been it's always because of the shop, but uber sorts it straight away for you! I love this app!

substitutions were chosen for me and was refused a refund for receiving items i didnt choose. when i placed my order nothing popped up prompting me to choose substitutions. so i was giving items that cost more and not the items i personally eat and when i told the rep he told me there is nothing he can do and ended the chat customers are not valued at Uber eats the fact that you have to wait 24 hours before you can even view the receipt seem super scammish to me to begin with.

It was fine because Uber would reimburse me, but this last time they said they wouldn't because I had reported too many times.

If the driver doesn't have a pass, they're likely to pick up your order, drive to the gate, and get turned around, then cancel it because they're dumb enough to think they'll be allowed on just because they work for Uber.

Uber eats it's a great app overall but sometimes you may experience poor customer service from Uber drivers which has nothing to do with the ubereats app itself .

The worst customer service I have experienced. They will not resolve any issues you might face just standard template email responses. Update: change to 4 star Eventually uber gave my money back.

The help center does not help resolve the issues at all. They always some work the restaurant. There was a glitch in the app and the order was placed twice. We didn't get any refund for the second order or the help did not help us cancel it either.,"September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mansi Jamsandekar,Google Play Store
"Rated 5 star in 2020, Uber one member since, and still 5 star. Had some bad experiences but majority (probably 96 out of 100) are good. Good service overall and great for parents wanting a night off cooking. They sometimes offer deals which makes it same price as pick-up. Make sure to support local restaurants by buying there but if you can't make it there this allows you to still enjoy your favourite food.","August 25, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mitch Guild,Google Play Store
"You will have worst experience if your order was canceled or no one is picking up from restaurant , it was horrible to solve the issue got international call to let me know that order was canceled after hours of wait!

The main part of the food I ordered was missing and they refunded me what the item costs but I had to reorder it and it cost more because I had to pay the delivery fee and tip again.

This is a very good app. I would like it to handle the back button better because currently you can return to the basket of a placed order and keep going back over a very strange user journey before reaching the home screen. Usually good service too,"September 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Adrian Orlowski,Google Play Store
"Terrible logic for when/who to provide adjustments to. The frequency of poor order quality is greater than other deliver apps. Why are the wait time ranges so big? Why does the estimated delivery time get pushed out by 10 minutes so close to the expected time? I'd prefer a ""your order will arrive between x and y time"" so I'm not waiting for an order while I could be doing other things with my time. I order from here when the resto isn't on Doordash. Skip and Ritual are better than this, too.","October 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Priyanka Chowdhury,Google Play Store
"Appalling customer service. Refund process is flawed/restrictive. They will not refund you for anything other than the bare minimum (the exact price of any missing/damaged items) and will not refund for the inconvenience or poor experience. Zero flexibility/not willing to provide compensation. If this were another sector or business, you would be offered a goodwill gesture as an apology. Awful. Disputing the transaction with my bank and uninstalling as I'm done. Up your game. Lost loyal custom!","September 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sam,Google Play Store

I was having car problems for 2 weeks and they delivered. Now when I try to order it says my address is ""too far"" when it's literally .03 miles from where I live.

"Do you enjoy watching drivers collect your food, then take it on a tour around Melbourne instead of delivering it? Then you'll love this app! Watch in real time as your food stops at multiple other locations before driving off into the sunset in the opposite direction to your house! Want to see it again? Maybe invite some friends over? You can! It happens every time you order! Hours of fun for everyone!","October 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Danielle Carr,Google Play Store
"Update. I gave them another chance, even ended up paying for the uber one service. You pay for this service, but if you want your food delivered hot, even warm, you need to pay even more now for priority delivery. Otherwise, the driver will make countless deliveries before yours, despite already paying for a premium service. Driver delivered order to wrong address and uber weren't interested, 50 quid wasted. NEVER using this service OR their taxi service, who have doubled their prices, again!","October 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Big Waldo,Google Play Store
"This app is good from time to time. Aside from constant notifications (even though I turned them off).

"Uber Eats has been bad before, but never worse than today. It's become expected they'll loose the sides &/or drinks & they give you a pittance back that doesn't nearly cover the inconvenience. If I wanted to drive somewhere I wouldn't waste my $ on Uber eats up charges fees etc. Tonight they sent my food by BICYCLE from a long distance in a semi rural area when order was already done, waiting & getting cold.

"Can't attest to the actual service but the app was a complete waste of time. It kept making me retry my payment (thought I'd put the ex date in wrong), I FINALLY was able to check it, but then it said ""Retry in a few minutes"", for FORTY minutes. By then I was dying for some Chili's who miraculously accepted the exact payment info. I'm done with every food delivery service.","August 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dana Michelle,Google Play Store
"Very Bad Experience, Ordered food and not delivered and its saying order completed and they didn't given any refund. Having this bad experience first time. I was waiting outside my location, I didn't get any call from them aswell. Also there is not much options to do after this problem. No refund, its company rules and policy. I am not at all happy, not going to try again.","August 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vineeth Kunhi Mangalavan,Google Play Store
"My previous review from years back was 5 stars. Update: Far downhill from what it was. If restaurants make mistakes UberEats will blame you . Even if legitimate with evidence, even if half your order was missed and the driver and customer service agree this is what happened. Ubereats gives your money to the restaurant and refused to refund you. Restaurants have no incentive to fix problems or avoid problems. Insane policies, disgusting customer service, all automated chat replies.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James,Google Play Store
"I love using Uber eats. Even if I'm ordering food or ordering a shop to come, it's great. I've only had one negative experience and that when they sent my food to another house.. clearly, the driver wasn't bothered about where I actually lived. However, I got a full refund! And customer service sorted the issue out really fast. Now, they've set up a pin code for me to tell the driver when he arrives with my food or shopping.

App support? If you want app support it looks like the email address given here isn't monitored & doesn't go to the support team. I have an issue with the app even after updating it. I needed to complain about an item in my order in the 'damaged packaging but food still edible' section under 'Help' in the app. It asked to upload a pic but app kept restarting every time I took it & so I couldn't make the complaint. Tried app support but no help. So trying to get it here as the last resort...,"September 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Jesse M. Cahill,Google Play Store

"If they deliver the wrong food, do not expect them to make it right. I ordered dinner totaling around $40 for my family and I received something completely different totaling $18. I had proof of the receipt, showing a completely different driver and after calling and speaking to multiple different people, was told there is nothing they can do.

Ubereats is a is a big rip off you get half your order if you get it at all please don't expect a refund not happening. The latest scam I took the app off my phone and haven't used the account since may but recently I get charged for Uber 1 and tech support is no help they say the problem is an account similar to my note not my account but similar and the issue is still not resolved very disappointing 😑 I highly don't recommend,"September 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ricardo Garrett,Google Play Store
The app is honestly the most clutch. They're acturate and structured. Customer service is A1 and the app is dependable.

"Their refund policy is very inconsistent, which I learned to tolerate but today I received an email offering $5 credit in exchange for doing a survey. Approx 15 mins later I finally complete the survey after which point it states ""Sorry, you are not eligible for this survey"" ... Why not? You lied and wasted my time.

Have had 2 bad experiences in restaurants delivering either stale and inedible or just flat out missing items from the order immediately after cancelling my subscription Uber Eats had denied both claims when shown photos.

Just horrible.","October 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mount Mount,Google Play Store

"Updating my review: There's some restaurant doesn't use Uber delivery picker to deliver the food. Is it possible to update the app to let us know beforehand that it will be deliver by the restaurant staff?

Overall, Good app to buy food and grocery.","September 4, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,ja,Google Play Store
"The delivery is a mess. The drivers are picking up and then refusing those orders and so on and my deliveries took so much time in my case, sometimes they don't even arrive and I get a message with my order being cancelled after 1 hour or more which is completely outrageous.

I look it up just to find out the restaurant I ordered from does not even have locations in this state.

I have, overall, had fewer issues with ubereats than both grubhub and doordash. The packaging seems better as well on both the food AND drinks. Only had one real issue with Meijer not delivering on time one night, but customer service made it up to me. It's definitely worth a look!","September 10, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Donna Kreate,Google Play Store
"The complete lack of customer service is not OK. I just got half my order and was refunded less than $3. Then if you consistently have issues, uber will caution you no matter how much documentation you can provide. The drivers picture can show no drinks and they will still give you the ""you're impacting the restaurant."" So I should pay for things I didn't get so you and McDonald's can keep profits you didn't earn? Also I've had drivers deliver to the wrong apartment multiple times. I'm done.","August 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rebecca Kepley,Google Play Store

My last order from Bonefish Grill was the worst and nearly $60 down the drain. They forgot my side salad, which I paid an additional $6 for. NO! UBER EATS DID NOT REFUND EVEN THE $6.

Thankfully, he had someone in the store to help him & was able to communicate with me, but what if that's not the case?

I like the service but prices are getting to be to much. I use the service less and less and every time I order it's no less than $60 for some people. It's half days pay. My order today was $40 and I paid $20 on services. If you calculate the cost on just services I paid 50% of what my food cost me.

Very happy to take your money (rob you) but as soon as there is an issue with the service they provide they don't want to know. The customer service is abysmal and I would be very careful about using this service.

Absolute joke.,"September 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tom Kuchta,Google Play Store
No option to cancel order which i hate. Because sometimes you have placed a wrong order item and you want to change but theres no option to do that!!

"Its a good,non expensive delivery system. I still stand by this comment but my last message was about Uber eats app advertising that items in restaurants were sold out and when I went there personally, it was not. I requested that you maybe update your app but the answer I got was nothing to do with the request. Therefore my rating changed as you clearly never read the message I sent and your feedback was nothing down the lines of my suggestions. You responded saying I had a complaint.

I expect to get what I pay for. If items are missing, they do not refund you, and you have no recourse.

He completed the order in his app without a photo that they usually take and gave the feedback that he couldn't reach us. He also said to ask for a refund as we didn't receive the order. We contacted support providing photo (of the food on the floor and the delivery person) and they said we can't get a refund.,"September 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Golden Jr,Google Play Store
Ordered McDelivery and this was fulfilled by ubereats. Did not receive my order. Told by customer support that the driver had attempted to contact me multiple times so I was not entitled to a refund.

No respect for customers time. Ordered an Indian delivery. Driver turned up with burgers. After around an hour their customer service accepted they'd made an error but we're understaffed so couldn't collect the right order. They promised to refund the cost of the order. Frustratingly by then it was too late to order something else so went hungry this evening. Also no recognition of the time wasted making the order and then contacting customer service to get it resolved. Plus the cash tip.,"October 4, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Andrew Livingston,Google Play Store

"If your application don't have ""report a problem"" or at least email to do this, quality of your application is bad. Just because you don't care about problems of your customers.

"Uber Eats as such is a great app - works in most major cities in the world and good UI. But a sign of warning: many restaurants are not using Uber Eats delivery, they deliver themselves or use Lieferando and often with mixed results - in Berlin so far none kept the estimated time, hard to contact them. Also no real actions taken by Uber if their drives behave rude or unprofessional. So all in all, with such end result, a potentially 5 star service becomes a 3 star service.","August 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Samuel Gustafsson,Google Play Store

"Super buggy. I've had multiple instances of the food getting delivered to the wrong house or just not appearing at all. And if it does arrive, it's a complete gamble on whether it's gonna be hot and fresh or ice cold. Also, why are people even allowed to ride bikes?

"Uber eats used to be the best. Now it's just as bad as all the others. Over priced, bad delivery drivers, and incredibly poor customer service. Recently, I've had damaged food, cold food, missing food; and Uber eats does nothing about it. They only tell you ""this order isn't eligible for a refund"" no matter the issue.

Yesterday I placed a delivery order to my friend's place because I was going over for dinner. The driver sent us the wrong order, from the wrong restaurant, with the wrong name on it, and said the wrong company (SkipTheDishes).

"This app is only as good as its couriers. I live in a complex with a security boom that requires vehicles entering to have a valid driver's and car license, two things that any law abiding citizen should be able to produce while in their vehicle. At least 40% of the time, I'm forced to drive all the way to the security entrance because the courier doesn't have a licensed vehicle or personal license.

"Uber Eats makes it so very easy to order and add special delivery, and always stands behind credits for misdelivery or missing items or poorly made food.

That in conjunction with the Uber One membership, which slashes off a few dollars from the order total, makes ordering food on Uber Eats worth it!

I contacted Uber Eats to rectify the manner as requested. 2 days go by, giving me this list of information they need to issue of $4 refund. As most Americans do, this is too much of a hassle to bother to get $4 back. They do this, I feel purposely to not have to issue these small refunds. Thus would go into a surplus account. I've deleted my app.","August 26, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Danelle Lucado,Google Play Store

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold).

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee?

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I wish I can post a picture of you can see how much they charge you for a $20 meal it is $7.98 for fees, this has nothing to do with the delivery, which is an additional $1.89! There is absolutely no way you're going to be able to tip the delivery guy with the amount of fees they're charging to! I don't stop using the app, but I absolutely do not tip anymore!

"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store
"One of the worst food delivery apps. My first order after Uber One got delayed by 25 mins from the latest delivery time. Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"". Finally asked them to cancel my Uber One subscription, they closed the chat saying we cannot do anything.

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery. I also feel that if you are subscribed to Uber one priority delivery should be either free or at a reduced price. The fees are high enough as it is.,"December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martin Patey,Google Play Store
"It's expensive , you're paying at least like 10-12 mote bucks than if you bought it at the actual restaurant. Uber one saves money but not much. They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience. My biggest issue is simply the over the top fees even with uber one.","December 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ration,Google Play Store
"App is easy to use. An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

I alos paid almost twice the food price for a chicken sandwich because of two sets of fees, taxes and (lowest option) tip. A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

"Before parting ways, I'd like to express my feedback. As a loyal Uber One Member, I've valued your small delivery service business with its pleasing attitude. However, I've noticed a shift towards a more corporate approach. Tipping persistence is just one of those.

As a result, I now prefer in-person shopping for better pricing and a more personal and appreciative experience.","January 3, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Dan I,Google Play Store
"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me.

"The platform had a bug which led to the initiation of a wrong order. After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

"Horrible app UX when it comes to placing the second order after the first! They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for. Last but not least, they use the driver timeout loophole to justify not refunding the issue due to an horrible app UX.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,chris,Google Play Store
"Communication between the app (Uber) and the restaurants is not consistently accurate, customization is no longer available in many cases, Uber is very hesitant to refund when errors occur and often refers back to the restaurant who will send you back to Uber, and on and on with no good solution.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it. That is more because of the restaurants that get busy from Uber and other ordering services than on Uber itself.","January 14, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Great Gabe,Google Play Store

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan. It just seems like a massive amount of data and computing power going to waste. It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store
I ordered food from a restaurant and i had an issue with the payment. But the order was still processed without me paying. I looked for ways to pay but couldn't find it. The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

"On your website you can't uncheck Uber cash as a payment even though there's a save option. If I am waiting for a delivery from a restaurant that just opened, I get zero communication from the driver/drivers that they are still completing my order or that something went very wrong. There are some days my delivery will go through 3 to 4 drivers at a time just to get picked up.

"After being bait and switched with an estimate order price of $24 (including tip) and then having it balloon randomly to $44 after it's ""locked in"" I'm out. It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee. Which means they're taking your money for no reason and expecting you to accept it to pad their profits.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

You can't leave a nice comment to great delivery drivers to let them know they were great and should continue on that path. 2.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing?

"Utterly poor service. They cancel order abruptly after having the customers wait for 1.5-2 hours. Refund doesn't cut it, that's just frustrating to keep 2aiting and end up startving becuase everything else is just closed because we trusted Uber Eats to deliver us food and didn't plan for a back up.

Because the app messed up I'm stuck paying $12 for a lemonade and I'm not getting any food with it. Customer service will not accept blame and offer a refund.

"Only minor complaints about the app. First, there should be a better system for restaurants to communicate they are (temporarily?) out of a sauce or dressing before placing an order. There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order. Second, U feel taxes and fees should be separate.

I placed another order and it went through, and then a few minutes later my first order corrected itself and withdrew money. It did not notify me until I opened the app around 15 minutes later.

"I used to be an avid user of Uber Eats, I even got the monthly membership because I felt it was beneficial since I used it so much. After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time. That was highly irritating, especially when it was a safety issue with half cooked food.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dana Bowman,Google Play Store

After that I was ignored. Thanks a lot for helping yourself to some of my Christmas gift and refusing to return it when it's clearly a duplicate charge.

"Drivers eat your food, missing items half the time, delivery times blowing out by an hour almost all the time, drivers using fake accounts and different cars, no customer service, this application and company is a disgrace.

"Worst app ever, I tried a new subscription to Uber one, and i didn't like it. Now they deduct money for next month subscription even before the defined date, although i didn't want it. The worst part is there is no way to cancel the subscription, and i basically lost my money because they deducted money from my account. I will not trust this app anymore.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KANAAN MOUSAEI,Google Play Store

"Stopped using it when my orders from a restaurant that was a block away me would take trips around the city before getting to me. You have to pay extra to get things delivered directly (even if super close) and if you don't, the algorithm will let someone across the city get their delivery first.

"Total rip off!! You have to pay 2 Euros more than the actual price for each burger (or hot dog or basically whatever you order).

Hence, avoid using the app if you can.","November 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Evangelos Trantos,Google Play Store
"I made a suggestion one time that they needed more late night drivers. I'm sure many people felt this way. It seems a lot easier to get an order picked up. I do however think the delivery fees can be pretty high. I tend to use door dash for that reason. That's why I go with 3 stars. Although I never made a review about my previous experiences, it would've been 1 star, so 3 I feel is where my mind is at.

I don't know if it is a problem between your ordering forms and the restaurant receiving the order, but it has become an every order occurrence that I'm reporting missing or wrong items.

So if they do this two hundred times a day🤔🧐🤬 I will never use this app again. Update 11/14/23... I'm back and did go back to the app after a while.

"Too many fees, the service it's self works fine and I got my food in a timely matter. My issue is service fees. I can understand having a delivery fee if your driver is driving an excessive amount of miles to drop your food off. That's no big deal. Then there was a freaking service fee that was almost $10 on top of the delivery fee, %25 tip I left, and taxes. What the hell is a service fee? This should be more clear.

"While the convenience is amazing, being able to pull your phone out and get food to the door. The prices have been inflated to a larger degree than if you were to either order from the place directly or pick it up. For example, let's say a pizza would cost $30 to pick up, delivery from the pizza place would be a total of $34; while on Uber eats with everything fees, paying the driver the basically forced tipping culture your order could cost $56","January 13, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Vin You,Google Play Store

I cancel order after placing a new order because there was no option to replace the out of stock item from inside the app. I get charged the full amount for canceled order that was the same as the second updated order with a substitute item.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service.

"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service.

"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food.

Always just way too expensive sometimes the drivers do a good job other times they don't directions for drop off are often ignored. I'm never notified that my food is here in a way that I actually get the message it would be nice if a driver could beep their horn or tap on the door or yell Uber eats or something. I go between Uber eats and DoorDash because I'm disabled and it's easier for me to have food delivered but I'm also on a fixed income and I can't manage the cost very often,"December 11, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Jana Magee,Google Play Store
"App works fine. Driversshould not be allowed to stop delivering your order to get someone else's, especially if it delays your order past the ""latest delivery time"". Sometimes places are closed and it doesnt tell you until after youve tried to place an order, and the pound of delivery fees is ridiculous. I also wish there was a way to avoid getting a bad delivery driver again, like a ""do not prefer"" option/filter. It would help reduce stolen food from drivers and filter out bad habits/workers.","December 31, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,ThatSamoanGuy “Caleb”,Google Play Store

I've worked kitchens before, that is not the k-time. It is 7 mins. So I paid for this and went hungry anyways. Drastic incompetence, no opportunity for feedback.

By the time they added on the fees and taxes, plus delivery fee (that doesn't even count a tip yet), my quick breakfast meal and coffee ballooned to over $40!

The app keeps taking them to the wrong place. Even after I did update it. And then no one can understand me when I try to call them and help them find me.

Too many times has my driver been unable to find my apartment because they do not read or speak English.

I bought some groceries only because I didn't have a vehicle at the time and I'm a stay at home mom. Instead of being a convenience It turned out to be a waste of my money and a dissapointment.

When a restaurant makes you wait an hour and cancels it or closes the shop, it doesn't even bother to cancel the order. All we got is an attitude that we should be greatfull to get a refund for the food that we didn't receive. Customer service ends the conversation when you start to complain.

"Experience varies based on countries. More often than not Uber Eats disappoints in Europe and compensates in the USA. Feels like Europeans have to pay the higher price to keep the US version going, while being offered a worse service than in the US.

The only response I get is that they can't give a refund based on the food being cold when it gets there, but they'll let the restaurant know. I wasn't asking for a refund, and this isn't the restaurants fault. But okay.","November 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vanessa,Google Play Store

"Delivery driver took over 2 hours to deliver food. I called Uber initially when it was delayed 30 minutes, they offered 6 dollars to continue my order instead of canceling it. After another hour of waiting, I called back to cancel so I can order my food, however, because I accepted the 6 dollar credit, Uber told me I would be responsible for canceling.

"I'm a student living in Brighton so I've used Uber Eats a lot. The service + delivery fee is extortionate, often adding £5+ onto your order. Drivers in my city also use all the other delivery apps simultaneously, leading to 1 hour to 1 1/2hour wait times on what should be 25minute deliveries. If your order is significantly late, Uber will compensate you however in the moment wait times can be extremely frustrating. The process of getting a refund is also very frustrating and takes too long.","November 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Charlie Dutton,Google Play Store

Uber Eats sucks. They give a total when you pay. But later on they give you your official receipt via email and you will see there is a service charge.

The instructions for order cancellation don't work and don't match the appearance of the app! And customer service is horrible!

They took it to the wrong house or kept it because if it says meet at the door your supposed to knock not leave it. If it says leave at the door then it should be a picture.,"November 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sherry,Google Play Store
this app is a scam and a fraud they used to give money back for orders that didn't come like order had missing items and now they recently decided to not give me my money back for corrupt reason. don't waste your time on this app they won't give your money back and definitely don't sign up for uber one they force you to buy more to get free delivery you're not saving any money its a gimmick to get you to spend more then you need and you'll waste money it doesnt help at all.,"December 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,GOTHAM CITY,Google Play Store

Not happy with the service to be honest. Always something going wrong with the order and its not restaurant's fault its always ubers fault. They take no responsibility and their customer service is terrible.

Terrible service from Uber Eats. So I placed an order and requested to cancel after half an hour as per the app the store was working on it and no driver was assigned. I was informed that I would be charged the full amount and the order couldn't be canceled I should call the store.

"Most of the couriers don't speak the national language of a country they work in. The time estimates are worse than a joke. Couriers make random stops with your food and regularly have several stops with routing that makes no sense (e.g. they pass my place by to reach further stop, without dropping my food first). The only reaction to these issues from Uber Eats was to state ""we are middleman, these folks don't work for us"". To top this off, the app keeps asking for courier tip BEFORE delivery","November 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Filip Malczak,Google Play Store

Orders frequently cancelled without any explanation (usually after waiting 20-30+ minutes).

The inflated food prices are getting out of hand at restaurants. Especially when we are charged delivery fees. Where is the incentive? The rising cost of living doesn't match the stagnant living wages. This also rolls over on tipping the drivers that keep uber in business. I'd rather these delivery fees go 100% to them.

"What a complete disaster. Why would the app first ask if want a delivery or not and then after I already chose the products I get notified me that the delivery is unavailable?

"There are too many technical difficulties and app crashes, especially today. It's extremely frustrating trying to place an order. I am now realizing that these issues may have been caused by a recent powerful solar flare. I do still frequently have technical issues with placing orders, though, with the app claiming that there is no delivery available in my area when I know, in fact, that there is.

"The app changed my order without notifying me, and I was still charged on the order. Had I known the order would change, I would have ordered something else instead of being forced to pay the full delivery fees anyway. The staff were also unhelpful, as they didn't resolve my case and ended the chat sessions, even though I was patient with them and I had a legitimate case. The app is also terribly slow and buggy, and the delivery fees are too high. Even a 1-star rating is too generous.","October 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anthony Pham,Google Play Store

They charge a large service fee, and consequently they do not even show you your total bill until it hits your bank. It is simply a scam.

"Good But They charge a lot in fees which is a downside. And for some restaurants the fee goes up to almost $10.00 which is crazy. I order food to eat. Not to go broke. Also they say that if your order is late past the latest arrival time they will give you a $5 credit to your account, if your an uber one member but they don't instead they offer to cancel the entire order and give you 20% is nothing off the purchase price to make up for it.

I can never find the option to include cutlery and condiments until after payment. And more often than not, the restaurant ALWAYS miss my customize notes to request for utensils and napkins. EVEN when I tip the 2 dollars to restaurant. 2) I wish we can decide how much to tip the restaurant AND how much to tip the delivery person and the option to add or subtract AFTER delivery.","October 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,L Lin,Google Play Store
"Very poor app experience for ordering convenience shopping. Shopper cant add items to your order so if you ordered multiple quantities of something and they only had 1, the shopper can only substitute once. So you can only get the 1 even if there are other different items available to make up for the missing quantity you needed. So, I had to pay the tip to the shopper (because I didn't want to cheat him for trying) and had to place another order for items that were RIGHT THERE!

I had accidentally backed out of the page causing me to longer be able to change the item. Instead of giving me the option to add an item or change the order.

This behavior continues even after the app is closed down, I receive the prompt at the start of my experience, which either a bug or (if it's not fixed) a very shady experience.

The overall quality that you get from the restaurants has sharply declined over the last year.

"After reporting all the missing items from my previous orders (I'm in a busy college town) my account was ""placed under review"" for making TOO MANY support requests. When my order was clearly delivered to the wrong address (I had photo eveidence from the delivery person where it was dropped off) Uber's support was not allowed to refund me or take any other action because of the ""review"" status of my account. Uber has underdeveloped systems and no care for customers, as long as they get paid.","September 4, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kelsey Dawson,Google Play Store

"The app has some features that are hard to use/find like contacting support. It is easy to contact support about an order being messed up, which is probably the most important, but if you need something else there is almost no way. The amount of coupons available of you have Uber 1 or whatever it's called is actually crazy to me. Somehow every time I order delivery the price in the end is either equal to or CHEAPER than if I had picked it up myself. For that reason alone I continue to use it.","September 23, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Eric Richardson,Google Play Store
"The app is sufficient in aspects of ease of operation and the interface is wonderful too. Has all the tools needed for anything that could possibly come to mind. The whole Uber experience makes parts of life so much easier. Update: It seems after so long with an Uber One membership and saving a significant amount on their excessive fees, customer support indicates you as not eligible for compensation when your order is incorrect. This factor was never mentioned prior to subscribing and is shady.","September 16, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,grey,Google Play Store

"Canceled orders. Late arrival. Wrong food. It's just a non stop lost of issues. Did you know that uber eats allows drivers to cancel orders, no matter when during the process? As it stands in 2023, drivers are using multiple gig apps to pick and choose their work. If you are one of the unlucky ones, they will cancel your order and do something else. Customer service is aware of this issue and says there's nothing that can be done. I know what can be done... I can use a diff app to get my food.","August 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vin C,Google Play Store
"The 'Tip' system is knowingly broken. While placing order, app asks Tip amount - which is fine. But once order is delivered, it asks again if you want to give Tip - even if you had selected to Not Tip earlier. This is bad but still ok. Real problem starts when you select Don't Tip this time, close the app & reopen it. It asks to Tip - again - just after few seconds of opening app, while you may be trying to click something else & end up clicking Tip button. It doesn't even asks confirmation.","August 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sagar Mishra,Google Play Store
"This app just takes the accountability off the restaurant or delivery people to do the right job. If there's an item missing then the only thing you're getting is a partial refund (price of item, no portion of additional fees paid) in Uber dollars.

Terrible exploitive app.","October 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jamie Lee,Google Play Store
"Charged fees for add-on items after showing a receipt without the charges added. Will not be using uber eats again and will be filing a complaint with cc company as I now cannot trust UE not to change the amount originally displayed when order is placed.

Got charged additional ~10USD than what the final price showed. When contacted support to get my money back, they only returned ~5USD, and afterwards only replying with a copypasted text that my reimbursement is already done.

Don't waste your time trying to get it to the minimum spend, just order what you want, it'll come out to less without the 'promo'. The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost.

"For some reason I suddenly cannot see or make options on orders. This means when I click on an item the next screen is blank so I can't choose menu options like topping, order notes, spice level etc. I've cancelled and reinstalled the app twice but the issue has not resolved. Frustrating as I can't order from most of my favourite restaurants.","October 26, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kim Larkin,Google Play Store
"Used to be a good app, but has too many problems as of late. You are not able to leave a review on restaurants or drivers, and restaurants can just cancel orders without telling you why. I spent over half an hour waiting for a subway order that once the driver was at the restaurant, the restaurant cancelled because they were out of something. Never even called me to tell me or even ask if I was okay with something else.","September 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Emmalee Hirsch,Google Play Store

"I didn't want to continue Uber One and I already cancelled it. But apparently I cannot even cancel my membership, and where the ""Help"" directs me to end my membership there is no button to end it. No customer support and no humans to communicate, and the Uver One is a total scam. Only ""selected"" products are free for delivery and they don't mention which ones. No transparency and no honesty in this company. Totally disappointed and I don't recommend it at all. Full scam.","August 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Elif Hürdoğan,Google Play Store

I was charged for an order I didn't receive, that I've cancelled from the start over and over again and saw that they're still processing the order. I've tried to contact them with regards to getting a refund, all I get are automated responses and they're contact number doesn't ever work anymore so if you have any queries about your order, they will fall on deaf ears.","August 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Siphosethu Tshikila,Google Play Store

However, my previous order was when I decided to finally uninstall this app. I waited an hour and a half just for the driver to cancel my delivery when the map showed he was right outside of my house.

The sneaky RATS will send you promotions that aren't valid or just refuse to complete the order, which is a nightmare to begin with as the app is unresponsive and full of bugs.

Disappointing. High prices and delivery times keep shifting without explanation or recourse. Bad precursor to chatgpt instead of real service. Recently my order just wasn't delivered. Couldn't contact anyone. Uber app claimed it was delivered but my food wasn't there. Tried to contact delivery person but nothing.

I would rate this app 5 stars if it wasn't so difficult to reach customer support from the app. I've ran into issues with the delivery drivers stealing my food or sometimes delivering it to the wrong location. The app used to allow for contacting customer support but now the option is removed and it is difficult to report an issue with your order.

"It's probably one of the better options in the UK in terms of restaurant options for delivery, at least in my area, but the app/system for customer service is awful.

I really don't recommend to use its not like hot it used to be. They charge extra and will remove items and mess the whole order up.

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers. I had a delivery driver steal my food and Uber (their only customer service is the in-app chat in which agents copy and paste the same responses word for word over and over again) refused to give me a refund.

What's truly unbelievable is that I got charged almost €40 for a meal delivery that was cancelled and that I never received (but I must say that when I claimed a refund, it was granted automatically, no questing asked).

Second one left the order on the street, and took a picture of it,most probably kept it for himself. I spent half an hour trying to find the place where he left it, to find it empty.unprofessional rude people.To bad I payed a subscription.uber didn't help, saying driver tried to contact. Good the first one harassed us even after.","October 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vanessa Barsan,Google Play Store
"Today's order says 7 min delivery like normal. But then I notice it's via bike. 25 mins later a cold breakfast is sitting outside my door. Went through customer support and the order is ineligible for refund despite being my first request. Pretty lame. I'll pay extra money to save time, but not for cold food. ✌️","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ian White,Google Play Store
Can't believe there's a service like this it's fantastic from order to the door in 10 mins subscribed to uber one on first day very good only downside with uber one Is you need to pay for a yearly subscription up front I'd rather a monthly option,"November 16, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mat Taylor,Google Play Store
"Horrible. They have the most mistakes and excuses. Customer service won't refund food that legit isn't here. Drivers won't message or call back. Wait over an hour for delivery because of app issues or driver issues and unhelpful reps. Rep lied and refused to let me speak w a supervisor, eventually disconnecting our chat.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Heather Stegenga,Google Play Store

The delivery workers still don't earn what they ought to for the amount of work and vehicle use required for this job.","December 4, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,David,Google Play Store
Unless you like to pay for items and never receive them as well as enjoy stale cold food that's been sitting there for over half an hour before pickup I recommend avoiding this app. It's not worth the frustration and I'm yet to see them get a single order correct. Worst app I've ever used. Menulog is the way to go,"October 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kate Deverix,Google Play Store

Not cool.,"December 8, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kathy Christopher,Google Play Store
Worst customer service. The last year was so awful. 90% of my orders were missing items and when I called to complain about it was fine till the last two meals both missing items and I mean entire meals and I'm told that because ibdrared to complain that I spent money on food I never got I'm being punished and told they cannot give they can't give me my money back or a credit for the missing items. So basically the customer is being punished for the crappie employees,"January 3, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jacklyn S Vervoort-Manno,Google Play Store

"Only 1 star because the app has made it extremely difficult to find the help button in order to talk to someone. Also I am trying to update my number but the app doesn't allow me to do it, saying the update is temporarily disabled.

"The promo code is a scam. It shows that the promo code is not applied. When I try to do it again, it is shown to be applied but the final bill does not take that into account. The customer service is so bad that rather than refunding me, they flagged my account when I pointed out this bug.","October 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rohan Joshi,Google Play Store
Im a new customer. I have 4 promotions none of them work I been trying and contacted Uber eats a few time bout this all they say is it's a bug nothing can be done about it. Why give people promotions that's not working but till want use to spend money with y'all. Fix the an problem and y'all won't lose customers.

I will not use them till the problem is fixed,"December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alexzanderia Welch,Google Play Store
"The app in itself is great, and the special offers are plentiful. Like any service like this, the quality of drivers will vary. The businesses on this app will not always get it right and miss some of your items. The reason for the missing star is because uber eats will take your money for services but will not always refund or compensate you for missing items that you purchased. I had to go through my bank to dispute a claim. This should never happen, but I understand it to a degree.","October 7, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Curtis P,Google Play Store

"Losing my interest as a customer. Prices sometimes, are way too much over DoorDash and they don't offer as many promotions any more. Recently, I can't even open the app because it has a bug in it.

"Used to really like it but the service now is abysmal. Drivers keep cancelling so even though you started out with an estimated delivery in 10-20 mins, you still don't have it 1 hour later and then it arrives cold. Tracking doesn't work either. Also had a driver ""deliver"" the food somewhere, just not to my house so I had to try and hunt down my order at 1am. Don't use if you're hungry and want more than a 50/50 chance of your order arriving without issues. Uninstalled, switching to Deliveroo.","September 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Annika J.,Google Play Store
"Never had a bad experience from any restaurants using Uber Eats. I guess the additional fees are a bit annoying but not much you can do. For staying in a major city like London, New York, etc., this app almost provides too much freedom and choice and you might even become a bit too lazy! But in that sense, it fulfills its purpose very well and then some :)","August 12, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Suyash Kumar,Google Play Store
"Use this app every day with no issues. Over the past week I haven't been able make new orders (only reorder). When I select a food item to order, I get blank screen and cannot add to cart.

"Absolutely awful app, I ordered a McDelivery using points via their app and paid £3.99 for delivery via Uber eats as I was skint. I requested it to be handed to me at the door. Driver messaged at 22.52 saying ""ive arrived"" but didn't come to door. I went out to see. No car, no tyre marks in snow. Uber said he was outside calling me, no recieved calls. Uber said he was calling etc so they lied and refused to refund me as its ""in line with policy"" - absolute jokers.","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tim,Google Play Store

I have had to relay on food apps a little more lately than I would like to due to health and personal reasons. Every order has had an issue. I'm at the point where they say my uber account is restricted and they cannot refund my money. This is the third order the uber driver has left my food in a completely different building.

"DO NOT GET UBER ONE. CANNOT CANCEL. Absolutely DISGUSTING business practices from Uber. If you attempt to cancel before the next renewal cycle, they will REMOVE THE CANCEL BUTTON and make you contact a support agent.

"I'm changing this to a 4 star because they fixed the issue. I guess Uber doesn't want us ordering on their app anymore because you're making finding things a nightmare. Before, I could just search for restaurants based on who can deliver the fastest, you took that away. Then I could search for restaurants based on the type of meal they serve eg Nigerian food, Chinese food etc, also, you took that away.

Most of the time it's just normal humans making normal human mistakes and I am fine with that. Ish happens, most of the time I get what I ordered in a timely fashion. The only is issue is that it costs a lot of money to order and I wish the order fees and services fees where not a thing so the price was not too much for the customer.","September 16, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Chinemere Kwesike,Google Play Store
"The service is good but the fee is a bit too expensive,it practically adds another 5 dollars to your order,don't get me wrong the food is worth it but the fee makes you a bit uninterested to use uber eats.

Why are drivers allowed to pick up and deliver other orders far away before picking up and delivering one. My order sits there waiting, assembled, and I get a notification that the driver has another delivery, look at the map, and it's like 10km away! They pick it up and deliver while mine is sitting there on the counter. Not impressed.

My groceries keep getting delivered elsewhere by the uber eats drivers, and the smart ones call and let me know that the house address doesn't match with mine.

Theres a 20% chance that they steal your food so dont tip. A lot less stressful to go to the restaurant directly. Put $0 as the tip then hand them chash if they bring it.

"Not once ever have I gotten everything that I've ordered. I am in Gainesville Florida, and no matter who I order from, the restaurants conveniently forget everything from sauces to entrees. The best part about it is that you can't even complain. The driver has no idea what you ordered and can't check it for you. Restaurants won't even take your call you have to call Uber eats and they can't send somebody out to get what you say you didn't get. I'm done wasting my money with this.","October 5, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Stokes,Google Play Store
I'd give it no stars. But you can't. They sold me on Uber one and a bunch of expectations that were never met. They were stealing monthly payments of $9.99 and guaranteed me on time deliveries. First I never received my food once and the picture they sent me was of a totally different house. I couldn't contact the driver for 10 minutes so non-stop trying. I called and I was not giving any type of closure or great customer service I just had to deal with it.

I told him that he is at a wrong location and that he should come to the delivery address but of course he opened the timer by then and kept talking on the phone. When he moved towards me, he marked the delivery as complete and did not deliver the order. Uber would not refund me for their mistake.

Can't NOT recommend enough.","September 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alex Vancica,Google Play Store
"Every driver is great foods always warm or cold as ordered they offer great coupons this week is 40% off total bill. Their monthly fee is $9.99 which makes delivery free, discounts on rides, AND Uber eats always has some freebies or coupons. i made like 14.00 discount/coupon back on my first dinner order which covered their monthly fee. Can't beat that!","August 12, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Kristi Lynn Clark,Google Play Store
Very dishonest. - food prices for the same restaurant are more expensive than the other apps - won't let me see total with the tip included.

"Yall should make an option that you can choose to drop current driver, if they haven't picked the order up.

Personally it's been a few years now since I've had a bad UE experience and that was a one off I'd blame the driver or maybe poor street lighting for.

You can't use it on alcohol but I bought me and kids £29 worth of Chinese got it all including delivery and service charge for £18 (was a pound service charge).

"Their service fee continues to be a joke. Do not order from Uber eats. Instead use it as a menu. Boycott All companies that increase menu price and include service fee. The constant notifications about this or that is annoying. Would turn off, but then I wouldn't know about the status of an order.

When contacting support, after an hour of ""your food is ready, looking for a delivery person"", support told me that I would have to pay full price if I cancelled.

Was really enjoying the service but Uber has really taken advantage . The app randomly took a tip from my personal bank account without my permission when i used the app within this week from an order that was 3 weeks prior. Aswell as no one there to assist with such issues. This is unsafe and i suggest other users make themselves aware to be cautious of using this app with their personal information.

Even if he is not reaching me, he should try to ring the bills of the given address, or even put it in front of the entrance door.

By far the worst food app. A couple of years ago they were on the ball but now you have to pay for everything so that your order is prioritized and then when the order eventually arrives your food is cold and the order completely wrong.

Always delivered and when there is an error they do what they can to correct it. Can't ask for more than that from a food delivery service. Very happy with Uber Eats and currently on a 3-month free trial of the Uber Eats premium. I would definitely get it if Uber did rides in my city but because they only have the Uber Eats business it makes the subscription only half useful. There should be a subscription for the cities where Uber doesn't offer rides and only food.,"September 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dylan Lalonde,Google Play Store

"Terrible logic for when/who to provide adjustments to. The frequency of poor order quality is greater than other deliver apps. Why are the wait time ranges so big? Why does the estimated delivery time get pushed out by 10 minutes so close to the expected time? I'd prefer a ""your order will arrive between x and y time"" so I'm not waiting for an order while I could be doing other things with my time. I order from here when the resto isn't on Doordash.

They will not refund you for anything other than the bare minimum (the exact price of any missing/damaged items) and will not refund for the inconvenience or poor experience. Zero flexibility/not willing to provide compensation. If this were another sector or business, you would be offered a goodwill gesture as an apology. Awful.

You pay for this service, but if you want your food delivered hot, even warm, you need to pay even more now for priority delivery.

My last order from Bonefish Grill was the worst and nearly $60 down the drain. They forgot my side salad, which I paid an additional $6 for. NO! UBER EATS DID NOT REFUND EVEN THE $6. All of the food was cold. I ordered Filet mignon mid rare, and it was near well done. The broccoli was RAW.

After 5 tries I just gave up and told them I didn't get my order and they refunded my money.","September 9, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Gwen Anderson,Google Play Store

"I have used Uber eats many times in the past, however they are getting so unbelievably bad lately. Only in the past 2 months I have had multiple orders randomly being canceled and drivers bailing on you and then mark the order as complete (while my creditcard has already been charged).

Today, I made an order for groceries and received a Spanish speaking driver (which is fine), but it becomes a problem when they have to call and verify your order. Thankfully, he had someone in the store to help him & was able to communicate with me, but what if that's not the case?

"The main thing this app suffer from is the inability of the store to contact the customer. Because of this, orders come wrong all the time. For some reasons restaurants also dont have the ability to refund parts of orders that are unavailable, and then Customer Support refuses to provide a refund. Horrible customer service. It really doesnt take much to make this app better, but Uber rather rob people than make an honest living.","October 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"Great app! Should allow to choose the restaurant chain store of your choosing, especially when there are more than one in your vicinity.

I like the service but prices are getting to be to much. I use the service less and less and every time I order it's no less than $60 for some people. It's half days pay. My order today was $40 and I paid $20 on services. If you calculate the cost on just services I paid 50% of what my food cost me. I understand people need to make money but I paid $10 for the driver's tip who gets the rest of the money?,"September 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Juan Carlos Casillas,Google Play Store
"It's getting better. The times used to be so off when you would order but they've turned it around so they're more accurate, probably because I got more drivers.

"Drivers get lost or register that they are on the way but half hour later they are still at the restaurant. They drive like hooligans so food arrives all smashed up. So you wait 60 to 90 minutes for a simple order. Very disappointed in decline in service level. When I first started with Uber Eats it was great, 40 minutes wait, good communication and delivered with care.

"Uber Eats is a great blessing to me, as my health has prevented me from cooking for myself and from being able to go out for meals. Though my diet is very limited due to food allergies, there are a few restaurants that I can order from regularly, and I know that my meal will be safe and will arrive quickly. (And when something does go wrong, Uber is quick to offer a solution, which is also great.)

My wife got a gift card for Uber Eats as we just had a baby. Using the app we were delivered a totally wrong order and the driver left immediately after leaving the food at the door. Tried following the steps in the app to fix a wrong order and the app just faulted and did not allow photo uploads. Option to contact the driver also failed. After 45 minutes trying the faulty app my wife submitted a query on her computer and finally got a refund. You know what works?

What's the point of having it named Latest when you can still change it to a later time. I have a rating of 4.98 on Uber as a customer. Technically I should be given discounts on my rides. However I am charged more than my friends who are not even paying for Uber 1 membership. Uber is scamming me of the benefits it provides in Uber eats.

". I haven't really come across many ads. The service is convenient and good but food ratings need to be updated frequently to better reflect accuracy of quality (flavour, texture, freshness).

No, verification was done to confirm that this order was being delivered to the correct location. The app gave a warning, but then pushed through the order anyway.

I'm not a fan of the extra charges outside of the delivery fee to the driver and at times I can't a refund or replacement of an item.

My experience has been 75 percent of time good. They need to have a way to adjust the dots on the map so the drivers will know the correct place to bring your food.

E.g. a restaurant claimed I had cancelled an order, which did not happen, I calmly explained my situation but despite informing me that this had happened 5 times THAT DAY to others, ubereats claimed they couldn't do anything about it and I would not be receiving a full refund.

"Uber Eats as such is a great app - works in most major cities in the world and good UI. But a sign of warning: many restaurants are not using Uber Eats delivery, they deliver themselves or use Lieferando and often with mixed results - in Berlin so far none kept the estimated time, hard to contact them. Also no real actions taken by Uber if their drives behave rude or unprofessional.

"The help system on this app has gotten significantly worse and it's obvious that it favors the system rather than the consumer that has a legitimate claim. I had an issue with my order but was not provided with any recourse for correction whatsoever when previously I would have been. My order did not have all the items I was charged for, but guess what, I was not afforded the opportunity to even produce evidence. Shameful from you Uber.

"The customer service has become appallingly bad. I placed an order today that consisted of 6 items. One of the items delivered was incorrect, as a substitution had been made due to the item being out of stock. I was not made aware beforehand and my consent was not given for the product switch. I asked for a refund from Uber Eats for that one item and was repeatedly denied, with no logical rationale. They have lost a customer over approximately $7.","August 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Donna Chase,Google Play Store
"Went back to Uber eats because they keep sending me offers and thought to give them a second chance but they haven't changed at all no customer service available, the promo codes are mostly invalid for some reason, NOT EXPIRED, that's why I went to Skip they have amazing 24/7 customer service and its very fast.

While my order shows the correct address, the driver told me that there was a different address, so i didnt get the food. I went to the restaurant to get my food, but they said, ""you have to go thru the app"".

Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour.

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold).

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it.

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop.

"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store

Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"".

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The fees are high enough as it is.,"December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martin Patey,Google Play Store

They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

"Horrible! Incredibly disappointing customer service. Always delivering late. Even with priority delivery payed. You would think a big company would do better. And when you try to contact them, they make you talk with a chat bot for hours with no help. And of course never a reimbursement. Even ask you for a cancellation charge when your order is more than 2 hours late.","January 1, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Albert / Franki,Google Play Store
"Tipping system is down right broken, you cant tip properly until AFTER you get your order, and even so the process of editing your tip amount is both buggy and incredibly messy navigation wise. Cancellation of items is possibly the most decieving and poorly designed system. At least on the computer, cancellation is done through a CHAT BOT. And they instantly cancel without telling asking to confirm if I want to handle the nearly $10 cancellation fee. This system is nonsense","December 27, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,PotatoSlop,Google Play Store

"The platform had a bug which led to the initiation of a wrong order. After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

"Horrible app UX when it comes to placing the second order after the first! They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"Communication between the app (Uber) and the restaurants is not consistently accurate, customization is no longer available in many cases, Uber is very hesitant to refund when errors occur and often refers back to the restaurant who will send you back to Uber, and on and on with no good solution.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it. That is more because of the restaurants that get busy from Uber and other ordering services than on Uber itself.","January 14, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Great Gabe,Google Play Store

I also wish replacements for wrong orders were an option and not just refunds.","November 23, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Tetyana M,Google Play Store
Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan. It just seems like a massive amount of data and computing power going to waste. It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store
I ordered food from a restaurant and i had an issue with the payment. But the order was still processed without me paying. I looked for ways to pay but couldn't find it. The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

"Support is terrible. Often they will advise there is nothing they can do, or to wait further for extremely late orders but thank you for your understanding, and will end the chat abruptly. Doesn't seem to matter if the store is late, or the delivery was bad. May as well go back to ordering direct from stores rather than using this platform. Also, promotions are far fewer, notably since getting Uber One.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ridwan Ahmed,Google Play Store
Worst delivery service. I paid for a priority delivery and my order came 2 hours later. And they refused to refund me as the order was placed over 48 hours ago. The worst part is that when you try to get help there is no available email to contact them.

If I am waiting for a delivery from a restaurant that just opened, I get zero communication from the driver/drivers that they are still completing my order or that something went very wrong.

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

You can't leave a nice comment to great delivery drivers to let them know they were great and should continue on that path. 2.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing?

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store
"My order request never arrived at the restaurant. The uber app functioned as nornal, and driver quit everytime they arrived at the drive through window. Ny 5th driver decided to inform me they never received my order request. I cancelled and was charged for an order that would never have arrived. Multiple drivers were wasting their time going there. The app also didn't inform me of a fee when i chose to cancel at that moment. Uber support completely ignored and disregarded the main issue.","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dale B,Google Play Store

"Utterly poor service. They cancel order abruptly after having the customers wait for 1.5-2 hours. Refund doesn't cut it, that's just frustrating to keep 2aiting and end up startving becuase everything else is just closed because we trusted Uber Eats to deliver us food and didn't plan for a back up.

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

I placed another order and it went through, and then a few minutes later my first order corrected itself and withdrew money. It did not notify me until I opened the app around 15 minutes later.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time. That was highly irritating, especially when it was a safety issue with half cooked food.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dana Bowman,Google Play Store

If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
I've not had a problem until today but it was a huge problem. Support is non existent and because of this 4 drivers had their time wasted and there was literally nothing that any of us could do about it. I tried to contact support to sort it out and was told they would get back to me within 8 to 12 hours. This is utterly ridiculous. Either have better support or more capability for customers and drovers to correct issues themselves. Or better yet both.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kathryn Carter,Google Play Store
"Worst customer service ever. I ordered several items in a order, and ubereat said one item is unavailable. I cancelled order and re place another order with different items . guess what, I was charged full amount of first order.

"Drivers eat your food, missing items half the time, delivery times blowing out by an hour almost all the time, drivers using fake accounts and different cars, no customer service, this application and company is a disgrace.

I'm switching to another provider until you turn yourselves around.","December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Thomas Robb,Google Play Store
"Worst app ever, I tried a new subscription to Uber one, and i didn't like it. Now they deduct money for next month subscription even before the defined date, although i didn't want it. The worst part is there is no way to cancel the subscription, and i basically lost my money because they deducted money from my account. I will not trust this app anymore.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KANAAN MOUSAEI,Google Play Store

"Stopped using it when my orders from a restaurant that was a block away me would take trips around the city before getting to me. You have to pay extra to get things delivered directly (even if super close) and if you don't, the algorithm will let someone across the city get their delivery first. Skip the dishes for the win.","December 24, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Matthew Remington,Google Play Store
"I'm receiving multiple emails with a promotion code that doesn't work in the area I live in. It's only for delivery and it comes with options for places in leeds which are obviously too far to deliver to where I live, and it states this too.

"Just switched over after having a horrid experience with a different delivery company and so far things are going great five orders in! My only complaint so far is that the one time that the restaurant delivered instead of UE, they didn't get my delivery instructions so the guy didn't leave it at my door and almost left without dropping it off at all.","December 13, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Keegan Holmes,Google Play Store
"Total rip off!! You have to pay 2 Euros more than the actual price for each burger (or hot dog or basically whatever you order). Which means that if you order 5 burgers for 5 people, you'll end up paying 10 Euros more than you would have paid if you had ordered from the restaurant's website. Hence, avoid using the app if you can.","November 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Evangelos Trantos,Google Play Store
"I made a suggestion one time that they needed more late night drivers. I'm sure many people felt this way. It seems a lot easier to get an order picked up. I do however think the delivery fees can be pretty high. I tend to use door dash for that reason. That's why I go with 3 stars. Although I never made a review about my previous experiences, it would've been 1 star, so 3 I feel is where my mind is at. Edit: They got better on stuff so I bumped it up to 4 stars.","December 5, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Greg Gibson,Google Play Store

"It seems that every time I place an order, something is wrong or missing. I don't know if it is a problem between your ordering forms and the restaurant receiving the order, but it has become an every order occurrence that I'm reporting missing or wrong items.

"They said I wasnt charged for cancelled order but I was indeed. I sent screenshot to their support but keep getting automatic response. Avoid this app if you don't want your money stolen.

So if they do this two hundred times a day🤔🧐🤬 I will never use this app again. Update 11/14/23... I'm back and did go back to the app after a while.

Everything cost more then it does if you were to buy it directly from the restaurant but I put up with that for the convenience. I have run onto so many problems but I let so much slide.

"Too many fees, the service it's self works fine and I got my food in a timely matter. My issue is service fees. I can understand having a delivery fee if your driver is driving an excessive amount of miles to drop your food off. That's no big deal. Then there was a freaking service fee that was almost $10 on top of the delivery fee, %25 tip I left, and taxes. What the hell is a service fee? This should be more clear. I had no clue it was a thing until I saw my receipt after I paid. Ridiculous","December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Andrew Lewald,Google Play Store
"While the convenience is amazing, being able to pull your phone out and get food to the door. The prices have been inflated to a larger degree than if you were to either order from the place directly or pick it up. For example, let's say a pizza would cost $30 to pick up, delivery from the pizza place would be a total of $34; while on Uber eats with everything fees, paying the driver the basically forced tipping culture your order could cost $56","January 13, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Vin You,Google Play Store

First they said i will not be charged twice and there end only showed i was be charged tip once, so account pending charge will correct it in several days. Few days passed, I still was charged twice, for several days to fight this issue they told me, there was nothing they could do.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work.

Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store

"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service.

"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order.

Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

"This Uber App and Customer service on here is terrible. I would rate zero stars if it allowed me. It's delayed with driver information. Then it takes awhile stating that the restaurant is preparing your order. But 30 minutes later nothing, then when I cancel they want to charge you for driver's time which was not even assigned to a driver. It seems as if the order did not go through. I pay for priority delivery and get a bicycle delivery with no food warmer bag to keep food warm. Food is cold.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nandranie Beerai,Google Play Store

The two stars i give is for the staff as i cant fault them however the 3 stars i couldnt give as the app can't cancel orders when a mistake has happened the information needed on how to do it is wrong or not been updated.

"There is no live chat or number or any way to contact Customer Service. Customs are requested to enter a promo code in order to submit issues with an order.

"If I could give no stars, I would. The only thing consistent about this app is people stealing my items and it taking 12 hours for Ubereats to rectify the situation.

"I should have deleted a year ago. Things have not improved. Customer service is so bad. When a restaurant makes you wait an hour and cancels it or closes the shop, it doesn't even bother to cancel the order. All we got is an attitude that we should be greatfull to get a refund for the food that we didn't receive. Customer service ends the conversation when you start to complain.

"Experience varies based on countries. More often than not Uber Eats disappoints in Europe and compensates in the USA. Feels like Europeans have to pay the higher price to keep the US version going, while being offered a worse service than in the US. US support differs from European support so much, it's absolutely irrational unfairness. I get denied food health hazard claims in Europe meanwhile never had an issue once in the US and the reps were always kind.","December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Elli L,Google Play Store
"The customer service has become so poor at this point. They will not reimburse/give partial refunds for missing or damaged items in most cases now in my experience. The latest issue I had was a drink that had spilled out all inside the bag when it arrived and the driver told me that it was the restaurant employees' fault for not securing properly.

"Usually, a good experience. Quick delivery, fresh food. That's it if you have no problems during delivery, and if you do, then they will provide 0 help. I got a problem where a Courier just stood still for 40 Minutes with my order, and when I tried contacting their chat bot for help, it just said that they might have been in ""traffic"", and I must wait. I couldn't cancel the order, because it was already prepared, and when the courier finally came of course, the food was cold.","November 9, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Gaming555 000,Google Play Store

I've tried giving feedback on this multiple times, I think the food is better left in a hot place in a restaurant while we wait for another driver. The only response I get is that they can't give a refund based on the food being cold when it gets there, but they'll let the restaurant know. I wasn't asking for a refund, and this isn't the restaurants fault. But okay.","November 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vanessa,Google Play Store

If you make a grocery order and want to change to an earlier time(8 hours from now instead of 10 hours), you simply cannot change the schedule time, even this far in advance.

"We have been long standing users of Uber eats until recently we are constantly receiving missing items and receiving cold food even when paying extra for priority delivery, on last order i literally watched a driver drink one of our frosties and claim Wendy's didn't give it to him and when submitting a ticket to Uber eats about missing items they indicated we were not eligible for any adjustments.

"Sometimes my orders are good. They have often been canceled with no explanation, but Uber Eats has offered credits (when requested) to compensate for those negative experiences. The worst are stores often don't include condiments (e.g. Taco Bell, KFC) when added to the order. Few things seem more frustrating than 16 chicken tenders and no dipping sauces, or 2 dozen Tacos without a single packet of mild/hot/fire sauce, and happening on 3+ subsequent orders (so it's policy not incidental).","November 27, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Michael Ivey,Google Play Store

After another hour of waiting, I called back to cancel so I can order my food, however, because I accepted the 6 dollar credit, Uber told me I would be responsible for canceling.

"I'm a student living in Brighton so I've used Uber Eats a lot. The service + delivery fee is extortionate, often adding £5+ onto your order. Drivers in my city also use all the other delivery apps simultaneously, leading to 1 hour to 1 1/2hour wait times on what should be 25minute deliveries. If your order is significantly late, Uber will compensate you however in the moment wait times can be extremely frustrating.

Uber Eats sucks. They give a total when you pay. But later on they give you your official receipt via email and you will see there is a service charge.

They tried to say the food was delivered but he was at the door nobody showed up after a long wait to begin with. He was right there so no it wasn't. They took it to the wrong house or kept it because if it says meet at the door your supposed to knock not leave it.

I tried to request a refund online for the first order, I wasn't sure what to select , so I tried multiple times. I called customer service and explained to them what happened.

Terrible service from Uber Eats. So I placed an order and requested to cancel after half an hour as per the app the store was working on it and no driver was assigned. I was informed that I would be charged the full amount and the order couldn't be canceled I should call the store.

"Most of the couriers don't speak the national language of a country they work in. The time estimates are worse than a joke. Couriers make random stops with your food and regularly have several stops with routing that makes no sense (e.g. they pass my place by to reach further stop, without dropping my food first). The only reaction to these issues from Uber Eats was to state ""we are middleman, these folks don't work for us"". To top this off, the app keeps asking for courier tip BEFORE delivery","November 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Filip Malczak,Google Play Store
"I was just left without my order for 2h. The person delivering the order called (after 1h) of wait to report it would take them an additional 10 min. 40 minutes passed without feedback.

There's too many restrictions and gimmicks to earn a discount on here; Even when you THINK you got a good deal taxes and other fees added at checkout ruin the so called discount. The app is slow and Uber is underpaying their drivers and limiting their working hours. You have to schedule hours now and you can only work 12 hours a day. I would give zero stars if I could.

Uber eats will take money out of your bank account for subscriptions to their services that you never ordered and then kindly tell you they can't help you anymore but keep the money. I was charged five times for 99'99 dollars and 9'99 also and I can only chat with someone and they say they can only give me 99 dollars back. Well where is the rest of my money going to?

"Every time I order, after I place the order it tells me 50% longer than the estimated time from when I placed the estimate. So if I pick a place that says 30 minutes, as soon as I place my order it says I'm 45 minutes away. After that, if I choose to wait, they're often late from that too.

Orders frequently cancelled without any explanation (usually after waiting 20-30+ minutes). Uber Eats then cunningly 'deletes' the order from ever even being processed so that you cannot inquire about it via their app (need to refer to a past order to be able to seek 'help').

The inflated food prices are getting out of hand at restaurants. Especially when we are charged delivery fees. Where is the incentive? The rising cost of living doesn't match the stagnant living wages. This also rolls over on tipping the drivers that keep uber in business. I'd rather these delivery fees go 100% to them.

When I ordered big order which was mixed up by the driver and I haven't recieve my food, uber eats also refused to give me back my money even when I had recorded and send them photos with wrong restaurant name on the bag.I will cancel uberOne","January 3, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna,Google Play Store
"EDIT: This app has so many bugs and glitches it's infuriating. So many times my order will just disappear from the app and I have to just hope and pray that it's still coming. Sometimes, the app refuses to let me change my delivery location, tapping on the ""save and continue"" button does nothing. When the app functions properly, I'll update my review. But for now it makes me want to throwy phone at the wall.","August 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Joey Hinkle,Google Play Store

"There are too many technical difficulties and app crashes, especially today. It's extremely frustrating trying to place an order. I am now realizing that these issues may have been caused by a recent powerful solar flare. I do still frequently have technical issues with placing orders, though, with the app claiming that there is no delivery available in my area when I know, in fact, that there is.

"The app changed my order without notifying me, and I was still charged on the order. Had I known the order would change, I would have ordered something else instead of being forced to pay the full delivery fees anyway. The staff were also unhelpful, as they didn't resolve my case and ended the chat sessions, even though I was patient with them and I had a legitimate case. The app is also terribly slow and buggy, and the delivery fees are too high. Even a 1-star rating is too generous.","October 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anthony Pham,Google Play Store

"Been ordering on this app for two years. Over the years, it's gotten worse and worse. It is simply a money grab at this point. They charge a large service fee, and consequently they do not even show you your total bill until it hits your bank. It is simply a scam. My most recent orders have been delayed by 1 hour to 1.5 hours, and the customer service is terrible. The contracts are so ambiguous yet binding.

I spent 30 minutes creating a shopping list (which I was using because of a promo) and the poor shopper spent 45 minutes shopping and going through checkout only to find many of the prices for items was wrong (to the tune of a 35% overall mark up on my receipt), so much so, I received a phone call that the shopper had had to decide to put aside many of my items to fit within the amount alotted.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristina Scaman,Google Play Store

I'm told a promotion is available, I apply it, I go to checkout and hit pay, and it says the transaction couldn't be completed because the promotion didn't work.

The second time the drivers tip was included in the original price and then again later the tip was deducted again. Support staff don't help.

In April, they brought the wrong order and were supposed to refund the payment. It reflected on the uber account that it was refunded, but the money never was actually returned to our bank account.

If you are thinking of using Uber Eats for convenience then forget it because you are likely to find missing items that you have been charged for. This is my experience of my last three orders. Yet again I need to go to the shops to buy the items they charged me for but didn't deliver. That's frustrating and most definitely not convenient. I want to make a formal complaint but thats not an option on the app. It seems their only interested in your money.

I would review 0 stars if I could.Upon placing the order, the cart showed lots of promotions applying and the total to be about 70$. Now, after having placed the order for 70$, I am being charged 117.26$. I was never advised of the price changes and after 4 agents cannot reverse anything.

Also they say that if your order is late past the latest arrival time they will give you a $5 credit to your account, if your an uber one member but they don't instead they offer to cancel the entire order and give you 20% is nothing off the purchase price to make up for it.

Shopper cant add items to your order so if you ordered multiple quantities of something and they only had 1, the shopper can only substitute once. So you can only get the 1 even if there are other different items available to make up for the missing quantity you needed. So, I had to pay the tip to the shopper (because I didn't want to cheat him for trying) and had to place another order for items that were RIGHT THERE!

This behavior continues even after the app is closed down, I receive the prompt at the start of my experience, which either a bug or (if it's not fixed) a very shady experience.

Annoying pop up asking to tip the driver. How about paying your driver's a decent wage instead of asking me to??? I'm done","November 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,D B,Google Play Store
Terrible experience. They take money immediately after placing the order. And then suddenly the order get cancelled. So I have to place a new order and pay again.

"Easy to use app, keeping things simple. The app likes to constantly remind users to rate the app in the Google Play Store, so I don't know how many times I have edited and rewritten by review about the app. I know I don't have to.

When my order was clearly delivered to the wrong address (I had photo eveidence from the delivery person where it was dropped off) Uber's support was not allowed to refund me or take any other action because of the ""review"" status of my account.

"The app has some features that are hard to use/find like contacting support. It is easy to contact support about an order being messed up, which is probably the most important, but if you need something else there is almost no way. The amount of coupons available of you have Uber 1 or whatever it's called is actually crazy to me. Somehow every time I order delivery the price in the end is either equal to or CHEAPER than if I had picked it up myself. For that reason alone I continue to use it.","September 23, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Eric Richardson,Google Play Store
"The app is sufficient in aspects of ease of operation and the interface is wonderful too. Has all the tools needed for anything that could possibly come to mind. The whole Uber experience makes parts of life so much easier. Update: It seems after so long with an Uber One membership and saving a significant amount on their excessive fees, customer support indicates you as not eligible for compensation when your order is incorrect. This factor was never mentioned prior to subscribing and is shady.","September 16, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,grey,Google Play Store

"Canceled orders. Late arrival. Wrong food. It's just a non stop lost of issues. Did you know that uber eats allows drivers to cancel orders, no matter when during the process? As it stands in 2023, drivers are using multiple gig apps to pick and choose their work. If you are one of the unlucky ones, they will cancel your order and do something else. Customer service is aware of this issue and says there's nothing that can be done. I know what can be done... I can use a diff app to get my food.","August 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vin C,Google Play Store
"The 'Tip' system is knowingly broken. While placing order, app asks Tip amount - which is fine. But once order is delivered, it asks again if you want to give Tip - even if you had selected to Not Tip earlier. This is bad but still ok. Real problem starts when you select Don't Tip this time, close the app & reopen it. It asks to Tip - again - just after few seconds of opening app, while you may be trying to click something else & end up clicking Tip button. It doesn't even asks confirmation.","August 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sagar Mishra,Google Play Store
"This app just takes the accountability off the restaurant or delivery people to do the right job. If there's an item missing then the only thing you're getting is a partial refund (price of item, no portion of additional fees paid) in Uber dollars.

Terrible exploitive app.","October 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jamie Lee,Google Play Store

Don't waste your time trying to get it to the minimum spend, just order what you want, it'll come out to less without the 'promo'. The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost.

There's too much security, so never change your debit card or phone number, And if you do make sure you've got the security codes for every card you've had memorized because they will lock you out of your own account with no alternative ways to login without information you no longer have access to.

Frustrating as I can't order from most of my favourite restaurants.","October 26, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kim Larkin,Google Play Store
"Used to be a good app, but has too many problems as of late. You are not able to leave a review on restaurants or drivers, and restaurants can just cancel orders without telling you why.

Never even called me to tell me or even ask if I was okay with something else.","September 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Emmalee Hirsch,Google Play Store

The sneaky RATS will send you promotions that aren't valid or just refuse to complete the order, which is a nightmare to begin with as the app is unresponsive and full of bugs.

Disappointing. High prices and delivery times keep shifting without explanation or recourse. Bad precursor to chatgpt instead of real service. Recently my order just wasn't delivered. Couldn't contact anyone. Uber app claimed it was delivered but my food wasn't there. Tried to contact delivery person but nothing.

"They put the delivery prices up by 3x. It was about £1.50, now it's £4.50 from the same place. Ridiculous.

"So, my experience with Uber Eats has been very negative personally. The concept seems sound and perhaps if you live in a bigger city it might be worth while. To me the fees are too much, more than 50% of the time my orders have been very late, they also expect you to tip before you even get your order (which I think is ridiculous,... I mean if you disagree feel free to tip your waitress next time at a restaurant before you eat and can judge the service), customer service is an automated joke.","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan Fields,Google Play Store

"Some drivers will take 4 deliveries at a time. Then, by the time you get your food, it will be cold. I already got Uber one.

I would rate this app 5 stars if it wasn't so difficult to reach customer support from the app. I've ran into issues with the delivery drivers stealing my food or sometimes delivering it to the wrong location. The app used to allow for contacting customer support but now the option is removed and it is difficult to report an issue with your order.

"It's probably one of the better options in the UK in terms of restaurant options for delivery, at least in my area, but the app/system for customer service is awful.

Unfortunately, your local store deals might not appear on the app, so you might be S.O.L. service is fantastic if you just want to stay home and have the food come to you.

The refund given by Uber Eats is never equal to the value I paid, and there's no way to hold the restaurant accountability and recoup funs from them.

My driver took 2 hours to not deliver my food. Ubereats customer care line doesn't work so I had to chat them where SUMRIT told me I would receive a refund after my order is canceled which it was after the 2-hour mark.

Gave it another chance and they decided I all of the sudden owed money on an order from 10 orders ago and refused to fix my issue for over a week resulting in me losing a voucher issued to me from my work for $20.,"November 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Aleina Stanek,Google Play Store

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers.

"The app in itself is great, and the special offers are plentiful. Like any service like this, the quality of drivers will vary. The businesses on this app will not always get it right and miss some of your items. The reason for the missing star is because uber eats will take your money for services but will not always refund or compensate you for missing items that you purchased. I had to go through my bank to dispute a claim. This should never happen, but I understand it to a degree.","October 7, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Curtis P,Google Play Store

"Used to really like it but the service now is abysmal. Drivers keep cancelling so even though you started out with an estimated delivery in 10-20 mins, you still don't have it 1 hour later and then it arrives cold. Tracking doesn't work either. Also had a driver ""deliver"" the food somewhere, just not to my house so I had to try and hunt down my order at 1am.

They don't listen. They don't care. They'll take your money but won't take responsibility.

Always shows way lower delivery times than it actually takes. Keeps postponing timing on latest delivery without informing user.

No procedures in place to detect and prevent food tampering. As a result 80% of delivery drivers consume customer food. Highly unsanitary. My orders have been messed with on multiple occasions. Last order the person was outside of the restaurant for 15 minutes and the food I received was sus as hell so I threw it away. Cool idea but there is nothing in place to keep orders safe.

"So far all orders have been good except 1 where the chocolate bars where soaked up in icea tea lol Prices are higher than the shops itself.

There have been multiple times where I have had my food picked up, then the driver will drive to a restaurant about 50 metres from my address to wait for another order, before delivering mine. Why should I have to wait an extra 15 mins and be dependant on multiple restaurants, when they can literally drop my order off on the way to the next ""stop""? It makes no sense.

Theres a 20% chance that they steal your food so dont tip. A lot less stressful to go to the restaurant directly. Put $0 as the tip then hand them chash if they bring it. But chances are you wont get your food or the restaurant accepts the order which forces you to pay for it when after waiting an hour but the restaurant is closed so you paid delivery and tip and got no food.

If I get it myself, it's about $12 but ordering through eats I payed $25. Why? The prices are at least $2 more for each item online and then you pay the fee, taxes, tip, so it comes to $25.

"Better prices than door dash. Favor has really gone way down hill. One UX tip I would offer: when selecting the payment method, it is unintuitive to select the card I want to use then need to click the x to close the modal. There should be a different button. It feels like I am cancelling my selection.","September 22, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Craig Stroderd,Google Play Store
"Ordered food last week Thursday and the driver took his time, not even responding to my messages because I could see that he was stationary at a local spaza shop until the order was canceled. Then he came after the order was canceled to deliver the food and I paid him, now it says that I need to pay that money again before making any order. I'm so disappointed with Uber eats because I've raised this issue since last week Thursday but no response.","November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lesego Madibe,Google Play Store
