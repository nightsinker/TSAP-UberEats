"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification. I order the same things but they never look the same or miss items more and more, the quality of food is definitely decreasing while the prices keep rising.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sahra O,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants. After years of being a loyal customer, it still doesn't get what I like and don't! Too expensive for absolutely no reason.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ishak Al Khatib,Google Play Store
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store
"Search function is awful. You search for certain menu items and they show you places that don't have the item on their menu. The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails. They're incredibly stingy with promo codes and they need to lower the minimum requirement to $20 instead of $25 for the 50% off. Oh, and I have no pets; stop offering me pet food coupons!","January 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Z M,Google Play Store
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour. By the time I was able to contact support, it had already arrived luke warm.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel L,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store
"I placed a takeaway order on UberEats and the status page showed that I can add items from grocery stores for no delivery fee. I decided to give that a go and added some items from Co-Op. When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost Â£7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store
"Horrible I had an uber 1, trial & when it came time to cancel. I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to. And that was days after the trial period was over and was expected to pay for the subscription, I never used the benefits of the subscription 1 single time.","January 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,james Linge,Google Play Store
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store
"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store
It user to be Easy to use. Very useful. But now if you have issue such as items missing or the restaurant not following orders which means the food goes to waste along with the money. Honestly annoyed with the changes. And any time you go to support about it they don't want to hear and brush you off saying nothing can be done.,"January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KittyCatNyx,Google Play Store
"Overpriced and misleading app. Got an email that said "" get 60% off your order as a welcome back"" so I decided to order for once. Clicked the email link, it opened the app, took me to the restaraunts that accepted this offer. I get to checkout and the discount does not apply. Spent 20 minutes trying to find a way to apply the discount, but there was no where in the options for it. Following that, the order was incorrect and cold. Unacceptable. Uber died and its corpse delivers disappointment","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Zane Elliott,Google Play Store
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store
"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store
"Update: bug has been fixed. On another note, to uber eats drivers. Stop leaving the food in front of doors. The majority of front doors open outwards. Meaning that food gets ruined or can't be access easily because it is blocking the door's ability to open. ~ App seems to have a bug. When I click on an item the screen goes blank and I can't order any food.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12. It's basically for ""emergencies"" when you're in a city overnight for a layover, but that's about it. But otherwise, love it!","November 17, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lisa Coester,Google Play Store
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini. What a scam!","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,anthonio j,Google Play Store
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available ð. I got charged over Â£6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available. I'm an Uber one customer, but I'm really thinking of deleting the app. Total rip-off money in delivery fees. There is no option to talk to a human being so frustrating.","December 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Nikolay Ivanov,Google Play Store
Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes. The blue dot of my actual location is in the right place. Tired of having to walk 500m to find my food sitting in someone elses driveway. I've provided feedback in the app.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Craig Galbraith,Google Play Store
"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange! Fix it","November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel C,Google Play Store
"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store
"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store
"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3. Certain restaurants get un-favorited every day for some reason. Even after adding back they don't appear in my faves.","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jeremy B,Google Play Store
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store
"Edit: Issue was fixed, updating from 2 to 5. Original: How can I submit this to a developer? For the past few days the app has not been functioning properly. When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart. Based on recent reviews in the Play Store, it seems others are having a similar issue. I've tried many work arounds, and end up having to order from my laptop or not order at all.","November 7, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,M L,Google Play Store
"Terrible Customer Service. I reached out for assistance with my account. I stopped receiving promotions and all the promo codes experienced errors and would not apply. I was sent one email and then the rest of my requests were ignored. ""According to the Terms and Conditions, Uber reserves the right to disable promo codes/marketing campaigns. You can still continue to order from the app."" This is not customer service. I requested a full refund for my membership fee and received no response. Bad!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Watson,Google Play Store
"Ordered from the app. Did not receive two of the items. Getting a refund via the app resulted in a paltry refund for less than half the missing items. Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I wish I can post a picture of you can see how much they charge you for a $20 meal it is $7.98 for fees, this has nothing to do with the delivery, which is an additional $1.89! There is absolutely no way you're going to be able to tip the delivery guy with the amount of fees they're charging to! I don't stop using the app, but I absolutely do not tip anymore! You can get your tip from that $10 that charging me for the service! Everybody should feel the same way!

"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store
"One of the worst food delivery apps. My first order after Uber One got delayed by 25 mins from the latest delivery time. Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"". Finally asked them to cancel my Uber One subscription, they closed the chat saying we cannot do anything. Best Cold food service.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Siddharth Sarangi,Google Play Store
An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery. I also feel that if you are subscribed to Uber one priority delivery should be either free or at a reduced price. The fees are high enough as it is.,"December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martin Patey,Google Play Store
"It's expensive , you're paying at least like 10-12 mote bucks than if you bought it at the actual restaurant. Uber one saves money but not much. They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience. My biggest issue is simply the over the top fees even with uber one.","December 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ration,Google Play Store
"App is easy to use. An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund. I lost 48$ I hope door dash doesn't do this nonsense.","January 14, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,kikyo jewel,Google Play Store

I alos paid almost twice the food price for a chicken sandwich because of two sets of fees, taxes and (lowest option) tip. A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

However, I've noticed a shift towards a more corporate approach. Tipping persistence is just one of those.

"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me.

"Uber Eats started out good, but stops giving discount codes for most-used services. For example, I only get convenience or grocery offers now, rather than the restaurant offers that I use most. I think it's time to cancel Uber One and go with just the Dash Pass. Shame, too. We used it a lot. It says a lot about a company when they stop rewarding their regular customers with offers they'll actually use. Door Dash doesn't do that, so I think I'll go with them.","November 27, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Michelle Jones,Google Play Store
"You pay so much money just to order food, and that's not considering tip. Why is the delivery fee $10, I'm paying an additional $10, and it's not tip? I've just had it. It makes more sense to order directly from a restaurant and pay cash and tip, without the ridiculous additional fees. It's so expensive and it's just not worth it.

Worse delivery app and service ever coming from someone who has used it for years. Despite having multiple issues the only help you'll ever receive is from automated responses that didn't even read your message or address it before closing it.

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

"Honestly, it used to be great, delivery was quick and rarely pushed back, now and for the last few months awful, delivery times pushed back two or three times or not even arriving, customer service is average at best but with far too many steps to get the desired result. UberOne was great now barely gives discounted fees or offers so pretty much useless.","December 21, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Cadoret,Google Play Store
"Stopped using it as a bug in the app placed a double order. The error didn't show up at the checkout and only became apparent as soon as I received my food. I immediately contacted customer support upon receiving my order to explain. After days of waiting they denied me a refund without explanation or rationale. Despite my previous order history of ordering the exact same items from the same place, they were not interested in investigating the app error.

"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

Finally got delivered cold and unsafe to eat at 8.55 because the restaurant had already made it. This was with a 10% tip and priority. I would cancel the tip but the driver that ended up delivering it doesn't deserve that. I've also been delivered the wrong thing on three occasions.

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item.

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

"Prices are deceptive. They will raise the price of an item at a restaurant, and then give you a ""discount."" So the delivery fee is always high but hidden. Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself. Was then blocked from asking follow up questions about this ""order"" that I paid for but never received. Very disappointed all around.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Megan McCormick,Google Play Store
"Lazy drivers and dishonest business practice. I had signed up for Uber One and decided on paying the $9.99 monthly membership, only to find out that it had somehow been changed to the annual $99.99 membership without my permission. Then, to make things worse when I tried to delete my account, I was told there's a back balance due for an amount I was supposed to be refunded. Based on principle alone, I'm never using this app again.","December 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Gonzales,Google Play Store
"Had a really poor experience and had no way to resolve it with customer service. Gave instructions to leave the order at a specific location. Driver called me to ask if I was there, so I walked down to confirm and he was not. 5 minutes later, I get a notification and picture saying it's been delivered... somewhere else. Called the driver, they responded saying they went where instructed and mentioned the wrong address. Contacted support and they said ""sorry"". Not acceptable service.","December 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Greg Kraska,Google Play Store
Uber Eats app is utterly disorganized and user unfriendly. It's geared for max profit to UE regardless of customer satisfaction. Help is not easily accessible which is unfair business practice.

"I have no idea how they still have a 4.4 overall rating when a quick scroll displays ENTIRELY poor reviews. Wish I could rate a 0 star. I canceled an order immediately after placing it, and they refused my refund because ""the store had accepted the order"". They also refused to actually send the delivery. So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie NegrÃµn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order. I have asked for more refunds and cancelled orders in the last month than i have in the entire year. Thoroughly upset,"December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan G,Google Play Store

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store
"Uber is complete trash, I ordered a burger meal, both burgers are supposed to come with 2 paddies, all of them were missing.

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account. You can not contact Uber to tell them that you have lost your credit card and need to give them the updated details because you need your old details to even be able to contact them.

The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

"Bottom barrel support, outsourced call center has no idea what's going on any time I try to get help, can't connect you to a supervisor and won't follow up with actual issues, regularly have issues getting worse and worse and will need to cancel Uber Pass and go to Door Dash if it continues.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless.

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Highly suspicious, not trusting and their food delivery is terrible service. Again would not recommend.","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nereus,Google Play Store
Their support is a joke. I had an issue with the app sending in an incorrect order and the customer service rep told me if I accept delivery of the order I can reference the conversation and get a refund. I followed those steps and Uber has refused my refund and I am unable to open a support ticket with a person to resolve this. There was one opened however the rep closed it out without my permission or everything being made right.

I'm editing my previous 1 star review by saying I wish I could make it Negative 1 Star for the fact that they also charge you more than the store for the food on top of charging you heavily for delivery and service fees.

If you don't set your delivery address before you order,if you order from different locations,and it goes to the wrong address they will not correct it only giving you a 50% discount.

Uber Eats offers coupons and promos (unlike DD) and every experience for no contact drop off is done quickly, efficiently, and without any hassle. The app is smooth & has a nice user experience.

Great! Great app. Overall they do some things right. They do some things wrong. I think they need to do a lot more background checks on some other people. I have had my food stolen and one of the drivers flick me off when I open my door to get my food and drove off on me but they were really good on responding back with me the support team and giving me my money back and credit and extra credit so I give them props on that.

Bad customer service. They have a lifetime refund limit and will just stop refunding missing or cancelled orders. I was charged twice for 1 order and they refuse to refund me. It just feels illegal. The customer service only makes matters worse and almost try to guilt trip you. I've used uber eats for years and I actively avoid reviewing things.

"Misleading information regarding arrivals. When choosing a restaurant with, for example, 20 minutes of estimate arrival, it takes as much as twice or the triple of the time (40 to 60 minutes) When the courier is heading its way to deliver the food, regardless of having other stops, the ""latest arrival"" is constantly updating to a longer time.

Uber eats have become the worst. You cannot even get decent support when your order is delayed so much that you can see it is not coming. Orders change status to complete when nothing has arrived and you have to fight to get refunds even after they tell you it has been refunded. Right now my order has been delayed way past closing time of the restaurant. The driver is not responsive and there is no support on the app. This is my second order in the space of less than a month like this.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chandini Wentzel,Google Play Store

I tried reaching out to the driver and they kept hanging up on me. I called customer service and they said it shows delivered and couldn't issue a refund. I kept telling them that it does show delivered but the house on the photo is not my house. They kept saying it shows delivered and there's nothing they can do.

My go to food delivery app. I like being able to modify tips as I have had bad experiences with other delivery apps where you can't. They are good at refunding incorrect orders as long as you include proof that the order doesn't match and it's quick to respond. I actually pay for the subscription since I use this so much.

Instead, they use the majority of it to tip the driver you already tipped, and then only giving you whats left over, claiming you did really get the full refund.

But slowly slowly over time it started changing as it gained customers, and no longer had the need to offer good and fair customer service.

Orders frequently cancelled without any explanation (usually after waiting 20-30+ minutes). Uber Eats then cunningly 'deletes' the order from ever even being processed so that you cannot inquire about it via their app (need to refer to a past order to be able to seek 'help').

I'm not sure how a $40 order turns in a $75 order before tip without me adding anything to my basket. The second thing is the fact that for the last 3 months, I have not received a correct order.

Even ordering from a fast food restaurant where everything is set up to be as straightforward and simple as possible. Uber Eats manages to make delivery more inconvenient then getting it yourself.

They dont allow an option through the order process to change your form of payment. Only through intense searching through settings can you change your payment option.

Charged for food that was never picked up and estimated delivery time got pushed back for over an hour before the order cancelled, by which time McDonalds was closing and so couldnt help.

"Their level of service has cratered into an abyss. Drivers can manipulate priority/express orders, taking extraordinarily out of the way routes and making other stops first, taking away the advantage of paying extra for priority/express service.

"Customer service is hard to find, repeats the same corporate speak script over and over about ""being sorry for your inconvenience"" but never actually does anything to fix it. Constantly assigns drivers who take forever before heading to the store (one sat at a location opposite for 30 minutes before going across the street... the order claimed it would arrive in 15-25).

The overall quality that you get from the restaurants has sharply declined over the last year. The app itself has become extremely glitchy in that if you use the reorder function make sure that you read your order very carefully before you submit. Sometimes it has a tendency to duplicate orders. Their customer service has significantly gone downhill making it almost impossible to contact anybody when there is an issue with the food that has been delivered.,"September 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ed Miller,Google Play Store
Uber Eats adda fees and such for themselves and the restaurants. The issue is they are also adding almost 30% to each menu item itself without telling you. The restaurant may charge $11 for an item but Uber Eats says the item is $15 when it is not. I feel this is a violation of the DTPA. It is highly deceptive.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terry Sangster,Google Play Store

Someone else had to which caused it to be late, but I don't think it's right to give them a bad rating or take their tip away for the other person not following through, so I requested that that person not be allowed to accept my order anymore due to the issue that arises.

Every time we have an issue with Uber Eats the refund and inconvenience has never been equivalent to the amount needed to make it right. This has happened on several occasions but in this instance (which is the reason I deleted the app and will not use them again) is that we ordered a $15.00 combo from a fast food restaurant and the combo was missing an item.

If I order from a restaurant chain that has one location 5 miles away, and another 15, it would make sense to flag the 5 mile one first, since the app auto selects the location when setting an order.

"There needs to be more options when leaving a review. The food might be a 3 or 4 star, but still be good. All the options for 1-4 stars are negative, only positive for 5/5. Same with the food, there needs to be a middle option between a thumbs up & thumbs down. I feel bad giving something a thumbs down when it's good, just not great.","September 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Cassie B,Google Play Store
"Edit tip amount didn't work due to network issues, 15% tip was chosen instead while placing an order. Canceled the order as I was unaware I could decrease tip amount after placing an order. Chat support didn't help, nor refunded nor got transferred to superior. Social media CS also did the same. Amazon considers one time exception and transfers chat/call when asked for supervisor but not Uber. Thank you for your amazing One membership. Edit - Changed rating (1 to 3) as help arrived.

"The interface to order something from a second location to be added to your order works so badly and is so frustrating it is basically not worth even trying to use. The number of times it resets to the first store while I'm trying to scroll through is ridiculous, and there doesn't seem to be a way to search for an item and then pick a store that sells it. Very badly implemented.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jayson Kent,Google Play Store
"First off, the fact that the only coupons I ever get anymore are for ""groceries"" is useless. I never use them, stop giving them to me. Secondly, having no option to request utensils or add notes to an order for many places. This results in multiple times where I get no straw or utensils for something that is too messy without them. The convenience is slowly starting to be outweighed by how useless the app actually is.","September 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reza CatThing,Google Play Store

"The promos are misleading af. '20% off' ends up being (no joke) 81p on a Â£21 bill with all the charges. Don't waste your time trying to get it to the minimum spend, just order what you want, it'll come out to less without the 'promo'. The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost.

"Terrible customer service. It's not the first time that delivery person ""fakes"" being lost and not finding the address in order for the order to be cancelled. They take forever to deliver the order... make calls just to make it seem as they contacted the person...And the funny thing is there is no way the app allows a user to report that kind of suspicious action.

Almost every other time I try and use Uber eats I end up getting told that for some reason my order can't be delivered as soon as I go to pay.

Uber cash is a lie. You must dispute with your bank, and they will fix it. So, they wrongfully placed an outstanding balance on my UE account. They falsely claimed I had to pay to fix it. I did not, but they fixed it. I reached out to support. Now I can't complete orders.

I have lost count of the times I have left notes on my Uber Eats orders for restaurants to add salt to the food I order during preparation or while they are cooking that particular dish. These notes are CONSTANTLY ignored by the restaurants!!!,"December 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Florina Rogers,Google Play Store

"It's the crappiest app I've ever used. Customer support took about 30 minutes of my time chatting and asking me to wait a few more minutes and being patient, then they said tech engineering team will get back to you and ended the support session without any follow up. Basically when they run into an issue they can't solve, they abandon their customers. That is on point for the Uber brand, rides and eats alike, you can always count on them to waste your time and not get you the service. 0 stars.","August 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Apoorv Jain,Google Play Store
"Works fine for restaurants but poorly for items in stores. Lets you order items that are not available in the store. Just shows up missing items and they don't tell you about it till the receipt comes out 24 hours later or you spend the time to contact them. Also since most people tip drivers based on the order size, you end up overtipping by quite a bit unless you can figure out yourself what the new total will be (they don't tell you for 24 hrs) and update in the app within an hour of delivery","November 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Zebair Ali,Google Play Store

Driver did not follow instructions and delayed our delivery significantly. The app made it very difficult to report the issue and offered no clear way to rate the driver nor resolution.

I've had 2 Uber eats orders for $60 and $40 that when delivered was the wrong order. one order was a door dash order and the other was a grub hub order and Uber eats says that that is not a reason to refund so I'm just completely out $100. this is not right it's not right at all.

I really don't recommend to use its not like hot it used to be. They charge extra and will remove items and mess the whole order up.

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers. I had a delivery driver steal my food and Uber (their only customer service is the in-app chat in which agents copy and paste the same responses word for word over and over again) refused to give me a refund. I had to file with my bank to issue a chargeback. Will be going to GrubHub. Never again.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sarah Gaestel,Google Play Store
Uber Eats is the least dependable delivery service available. They are never on time if they even show up with your order at all.

All that time the delivery was ""on it's way"" but in fact it was just pending and no one even started preparing it, untill the store was closed.

"Horrible customer service. Had the wrong order delivered on a couple occasions. Users stance is ""we already have your money so we don't care about anything after that"" They have also changed their customer service to AI, and a cheap AI at that.

I asked to speak to a human I was able to communicate in a chat and the human only responded with pre-written auto-replies, I might as well been talking to AI.

"This is a great app, easy to navigate and simple to use but the best thing is, after you've ordered and pressed confirm, it still gives you seven to ten seconds in case you have changed your mind for whatever reason.

"For the most part, some restaurants are great to order from. Other restaurants can't seem to get the food to the driver quick enough so it stays warm.

Don't trust this sorry place. There's app is so out dated. They will charge your credit card out of the blue. Then after you have a issue with your food. They don't want to stand up and face the facts that the food was wrong. Customers have to contact there bank for a refund.Sorry place.Never will use again.

So why is the food double the price, and why charge damn near $10 for my order size?

"Relentlessly harrasses me to turn on notifications to the point where it will even exit an in-progress order to hit me with a reminder pop-up. The one time I did turn on notifications it then spammed me to death with stupid promotions I didn't want. I'm not sure how this is even legal.

They force you into paying for an order you don't even want. I placed an order to a grocery store and was alerted that they couldn't find half of my order. So I tried to cancel it but in order to do that you have to wait for customer support which takes 7 minutes. By that time customer support told me it's too late the order is already on its way. I can cancel the order but they will still charge me for it. Then upon telling them I am not happy with this situation they ended the chat with me.,"October 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joanna King,Google Play Store
You have a 5% chance that your order will be complete without any item missing or something being wrong with your order. The incompetence of people working in restaurants is absolutely mind blowing and the drivers are either illiterate or completely stupid and are unable to follow simple directions and drops your order anywhere they want. Most of the time your order is stone cold by the time it gets to you. Monkeys would be more competent than any of them.,"October 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wolfsritter (Wolfsritter),Google Play Store

This app will cancel your order and give you no explanation as to why it was cancelled. The order that gets cancelled won't show up on the application in order history.

"I've been using Uber eats regularly for the past two years. Today, for the second time they made me wait 2 hours just to receive ice cold soggy food. When contacting support, after an hour of ""your food is ready, looking for a delivery person"", support told me that I would have to pay full price if I cancelled. Support on the app is basically non existent, if you're lucky you get a chat bot, otherwise you just get a ""we've received your request and are ""carefully"" reviewing it""","October 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ian Jakubek,Google Play Store
Was really enjoying the service but Uber has really taken advantage . The app randomly took a tip from my personal bank account without my permission when i used the app within this week from an order that was 3 weeks prior. Aswell as no one there to assist with such issues. This is unsafe and i suggest other users make themselves aware to be cautious of using this app with their personal information.

"I got scammed by a restaurant who is known to not deliver orders, I sat outside for several hours at the agreed spot just for nothing to arrive, I waited until 5am, well past the restaurants closing time just for nothing to show up, they did not pick up their phone and did not provide updates through the app even upon request. I provided Uber support with proof of me being at the location including picture evidence. I had to cancel due to it just being past 5am, I deserve my refund.","September 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martijn Klerks,Google Play Store
"The driver wasn't able to reach me by phone, so he decided to put the food on the street away of my building door, and someone stole it. Even if he is not reaching me, he should try to ring the bills of the given address, or even put it in front of the entrance door. I contacted the customer support and they refused to refund my order. It looks I should pay for the careless behaviour of the driver.

"I decided to update my 1 star review as I started using the service again after a year. They've improved a ton since last year.

Whatever Uber did to fix these issues seem to have worked in my case. As always though, your milage my vary.","October 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Andrew Arce,Google Play Store
By far the worst food app. A couple of years ago they were on the ball but now you have to pay for everything so that your order is prioritized and then when the order eventually arrives your food is cold and the order completely wrong. I think drivers should be held accountable for not checking before they take the order. Fix the issue on the spot! I'm not going to wait a couple of days for a refund!

I absolutely love this app if I don't feel to cook anything I can just order on my phone and it will come quite quickly the only problem I have with this app is the delivery fee sometimes I think it quite overwhelming with the amount you have to spend base on the delivery charges.,"October 3, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Nathan Roberts,Google Play Store
Always delivered and when there is an error they do what they can to correct it. Can't ask for more than that from a food delivery service. Very happy with Uber Eats and currently on a 3-month free trial of the Uber Eats premium. I would definitely get it if Uber did rides in my city but because they only have the Uber Eats business it makes the subscription only half useful. There should be a subscription for the cities where Uber doesn't offer rides and only food.,"September 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dylan Lalonde,Google Play Store

Are you scamming me. Then, when I called customer service saying that I was facing this issue, they said, ""Order was placed to the merchant, we can't do anything.""

Usually good service too,"September 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Adrian Orlowski,Google Play Store
"Terrible logic for when/who to provide adjustments to. The frequency of poor order quality is greater than other deliver apps. Why are the wait time ranges so big? Why does the estimated delivery time get pushed out by 10 minutes so close to the expected time? I'd prefer a ""your order will arrive between x and y time"" so I'm not waiting for an order while I could be doing other things with my time. I order from here when the resto isn't on Doordash. Skip and Ritual are better than this, too.","October 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Priyanka Chowdhury,Google Play Store
"Appalling customer service. Refund process is flawed/restrictive. They will not refund you for anything other than the bare minimum (the exact price of any missing/damaged items) and will not refund for the inconvenience or poor experience. Zero flexibility/not willing to provide compensation. If this were another sector or business, you would be offered a goodwill gesture as an apology. Awful.

You pay for this service, but if you want your food delivered hot, even warm, you need to pay even more now for priority delivery.

For some reasons restaurants also dont have the ability to refund parts of orders that are unavailable, and then Customer Support refuses to provide a refund. Horrible customer service. It really doesnt take much to make this app better, but Uber rather rob people than make an honest living.","October 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"Great app! Should allow to choose the restaurant chain store of your choosing, especially when there are more than one in your vicinity. Same restaurant chains store should all have the same delivery fee. Delivery fee should not change, no matter what time of day, I have seen them change for the same restaurant, depending on the time of day.","October 13, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Bob Castonguay,Google Play Store
"The app does not accurately update and map the location of the delivery. Though the variety of restaurants are good, recent updates don't allow rating of delivery personal, only a report if they did something atrocious. Beware of the hidden Service fees!!!","August 14, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,SaKa Hos,Google Play Store
"Charged twice for ""verification"" all the time even though I use this app for years. It's been 2 days since refund and I needed to pay a bill. Support didn't help just pointed me to my bank who pointed me back to Uber for some verification. Little silly but it caused me so much drama for what...?","October 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,zac S,Google Play Store
Update: app experience much improved however the app keeps sending drivers to the back of my house on another street... Not able to order alcohol. I have 1 bottle in my cart but it says I'm exceeding the limit. There is no way of contacting uber because they don't want to help so all I can do is 1 star.,"September 29, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Brian Gavin,Google Play Store
"App's 'Manage Membership' screen does not let you cancel UberOne, seems like a deliberate attempt to make the process difficult so be mindful of this when signing up. Contacting support is also a difficult task if there isn't an active order.","August 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,BlackOwl GPS,Google Play Store
"I'm traveling, never used Uber Eats before until now. Won't use it again. I left instructions for the driver that said I'd meet him at the door, since there's no way to buzz him in. The food was delivered and just left outside the door. I'm renting an Airbnb in a large city and by the time I get down there almost all of its been taken, pizza boxes all over the side walk.","August 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brady Sheehy,Google Play Store
"The best thing about Uber Eats is that its presence is global, and almost all the good restaurants are included in the list. Service is also decent and you can order almost all the cuisines which are available in the area. Unfortunately, some good eateries like Angus Jack are not available to order from, but apart from it, it is a fantastic app.","October 7, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mohit Sharma,Google Play Store
So 1st time using app and it says I got 20$ off my first 2 orders (for delivery/ also only applies to specific businesses) but yet any order I've done so far doesn't work or apply on any. Seems like yet another bs deal just to get you to use app.... really annoying. Edit: after messing around for 40 mins trying to get it to work imma just delete this app. Waste of my time.,"September 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Walker Ettestad (Gucci),Google Play Store
"I have had an order with roughly 10 items, with total value being 20Â£, but when driver arrived, only came with 3 items. Asked ubereats support regarding this issue, and they have refunded me 6Â£, which I still have not received. (when the missing items were more than 13Â£!) Would strongly advise to stay away from this app, these people will rob you in front of your face and tell you that youre in the wrong.","September 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Fluzzy,Google Play Store
I like the service but prices are getting to be to much. I use the service less and less and every time I order it's no less than $60 for some people. It's half days pay. My order today was $40 and I paid $20 on services. If you calculate the cost on just services I paid 50% of what my food cost me. I understand people need to make money but I paid $10 for the driver's tip who gets the rest of the money?,"September 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Juan Carlos Casillas,Google Play Store
"It's getting better. The times used to be so off when you would order but they've turned it around so they're more accurate, probably because I got more drivers. They have good promotions and the AMX benefit helps so I'll be continuing to use this great app.","August 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Lou Sacco,Google Play Store
"Did not even read my query and your help options does not cover the query i had, and it seemed like the help consultant did not read my query properly. And spoke about an 'authorization hold', and the query was that they literally deducted the tip on the main amount and additionally charged the tip again. And now i have to waste my time sorting this out. First time I'm using this app on vacation, and this is what happens.","August 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,RV Vic Benjamin,Google Play Store
"Not really worth the monthly fee anymore. They haven't had discount on restaurants for months now. Only discounts on grocery and convenience stores, which offer items at higher costs. Going to stop membership.","August 19, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Yvette Lopez,Google Play Store
"Customer service is abysmal, especially when it comes to severe food allergies. I placed an order that was clearly marked as gluten free on the menu, I also noted it was celiac issues. After placing the order, the restaurante called and stated that they don't have gluten free options and still made the food ignoring all the instructions. I was still fully charged for and order that was cancelled and not delivered. If I could rate them lower then 1 star I would. Please use any other delivery app.","August 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Greg Harris,Google Play Store
"Drivers get lost or register that they are on the way but half hour later they are still at the restaurant. They drive like hooligans so food arrives all smashed up. So you wait 60 to 90 minutes for a simple order. Very disappointed in decline in service level. When I first started with Uber Eats it was great, 40 minutes wait, good communication and delivered with care. Now, like everything else in South Africa you have to be satisfied with sub standard service. Plus you can't cancel order","August 31, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Denise Venter,Google Play Store
"For some reason it doesnt have an instant ""contact agent"" link/button in the help section, just ""useful topics"" which just arent and lead to nothing. No phone number to ring or email to send an email too. Finally found a number and the automated voice hangs up on you. I guess ill just allow uber to rob me once a month by activating uber one when i havent got it active/have to keep deativating it now, what a disgusting, backdtabbing company. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","August 6, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Gaskell,Google Play Store
BEWARE!!! Uber steals your money if you instantly cancel an order. Customer service was rude and disconnected communication about this dispute. The restaurant canceled on their end but I was still charged the full amount for nothing at all. Do not use this app!!!! Such a terrible company policy.,"August 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alex DiMella,Google Play Store
"It's a convenient service. However, they tend to send through an adjusted total to your card after you've received and eaten your food, which automatically goes through. Seems like a sketchy practice.","August 26, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Rodnie Bohannon,Google Play Store
Very happy to take your money (rob you) but as soon as there is an issue with the service they provide they don't want to know. The customer service is abysmal and I would be very careful about using this service. I will now delete this app as they have taken Â£32 from my bank and my food never arrived and uber think that is acceptable. Absolute joke.,"September 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tom Kuchta,Google Play Store
No option to cancel order which i hate. Because sometimes you have placed a wrong order item and you want to change but theres no option to do that!! So uber should have that option where we can cancel all orders including grocery shopping too or add an item on.,"September 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Anonymous,Google Play Store
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber keeps charging and refunding my account for Uber One on any payment methods I had saved. I haven't had Uber One in over a year, which ""customer service"" reps confirm. Yet no one can do anything about making sure I'm not charged for a service I don't subscribe to. I went ahead and deleted all payment methods to save myself the inconvenience.","September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kara Martin,Google Play Store
"Its a good,non expensive delivery system. I still stand by this comment but my last message was about Uber eats app advertising that items in restaurants were sold out and when I went there personally, it was not. I requested that you maybe update your app but the answer I got was nothing to do with the request. Therefore my rating changed as you clearly never read the message I sent and your feedback was nothing down the lines of my suggestions. You responded saying I had a complaint. READ IT.","October 18, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shane,Google Play Store
"Driver decided to cancel my first order. Had to reorder, so it took about 2 hours to eat. Food was cold and poorly cooked. Was also missing several items. I told support I wasn't happy with my service. They asked for a picture which I honeslty forgot to take. So they gave me a $2 credit on a $60 taco bell order. I told them to keep the $2 as I will no longer be a customer.","September 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ted Voyles,Google Play Store

"This app needs options in its ""Help"" section for when drivers leave the food at the wrong apartment or house. My driver left food at the wrong apartment and he took a picture of their door but this is a big place and I have no idea where it is. When I tried to call him, the call was rejected every time. Then when i tried to get help on the app it said that he took a picture of the deliered food and it wouldn't let me go further with my issue. I had a ridiculous time trying to get my money back.","September 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Rhianna French,Google Play Store
"When I moved to a more populated city I was able to use this service. Back in my old town, all we had was grubhub and Doordash. I've always had my order cold and messed up with those 2 apps so there is no way I'd ever go back. I have an UberOne membership because I really do enjoy using this service versus their competitors. The delivery people that hand me or leave my food at the door are reliable, on time and know how to treat a customer right. I'm very glad I am using this service.","August 14, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Miranda Thompson,Google Play Store
"Uber has been up and down in my books over the last 10 years. But I can say, within the last 2-3 years, it has bounced back from COVID, and provided jobs for ppl. The service has improved and has come through on occasions when I didn't expect it to. I give Uber 5 stars because it's grown and adapted through a hard time for everyone.","October 16, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mike Righi,Google Play Store
"I am super dissapointed with this app. I was ordering as usually and could not understand why i have to pay so much. It is because uber eats is giving you in the search bar only the farest away chain restaurants such as A&W and is not showing you the closest one. In order to pay 1.99$ for delivery, I paied 7.99$. That is completely awful dear uber eats. For an order of just 30$ i had to pay damn Ã2. It happend to me few times already and I'm very dissapointed. I will turn off my ue account .","September 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ip Victoria,Google Play Store
"This app must be for the rich. 11 dollars for some breakfast burritos from 3 minutes down the road. Says ""0$ DELIVERY FEE"" front and center. Tries to hide the fine print on a LATER page that says it only applies to orders of 15 or higher. The app then tries to actively hide the total from you, so you wont notice that your 11 dollar order is now a 24 dollar order because 5 dollar delivery fee, 5 dollars for ""taxes and other fees"" like the F you fee I guess, dunno, it doesnt tell you. And then tip","August 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bell Idrael,Google Play Store

This place sucks to the fact that I was trying to cancel my order and I was unable to compare to doordash which I'm able to cancel my order if needs to be but I've never had a problem for doordash. The problem is that my order from bnm's barbecue is from Northfield in miles I live in Cleveland Heights. My food is going to be extremely cold and I try to let them know this and my order be cancelled was refused. I would never order from ubereats again. I have not ordered from them for three years.,"October 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cecilia Foreman,Google Play Store
"Absolutely horrible customer service. My order was missing a $9 item, but even though you report it missing, support informs you that you aren't eligible for a refund. That is not right. I expect to get what I pay for. If items are missing, they do not refund you, and you have no recourse. The ""support"" chat doesn't use great English, and when you ask why they won't refund your missing items, they just repeat themselves and say they can't refund you. Absolutely terrible how they treat customers","October 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Timothy Welling,Google Play Store
Extremely disappointed by the support. During a delivery I was waiting the delivery person by the door and I saw him dropping the bag with food. He completed the order in his app without a photo that they usually take and gave the feedback that he couldn't reach us. He also said to ask for a refund as we didn't receive the order. We contacted support providing photo (of the food on the floor and the delivery person) and they said we can't get a refund.,"September 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Golden Jr,Google Play Store
Ordered McDelivery and this was fulfilled by ubereats. Did not receive my order. Told by customer support that the driver had attempted to contact me multiple times so I was not entitled to a refund. One phone call and that was after I rang him asking where my food was and all he did was just say hello down the phone repeatedly. I texted him to confirm my address with no reply. Used ubereats many times without problems. If you have a problem then the customer service is frankly shocking.,"September 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel Norman,Google Play Store

"Easy to use app and even tho there has been a couple mishaps with either the restaurant forgetting an item, or the time 1 of my order was never delivered, UE Customer Service has been extremely helpful with providing a solution.

"I edited my great review. Pretty shadey to have a pop up where you click stars to review the last place you ordered from, THEN IMMEDIATELY HAVE A POP UP COVER THAT ONE, SIGNING YOU UP FOR A MONTHLY SERVICE. So instead of clicking 5 starts you sign up for a monthly service. I've gone through all my account settings and there is no place to cancel. I'm sure you have to call, and be put on hold.

"I use Uber eats a lot when I'm depressed or sick and it's great for that, but the design of the app and user experience is pretty subpar.

"Ordered a 45 dollar order the order was delivered to the wrong address even though the correct address was clearly started on the order information. Due to the failure of the driver and deliverer.

App only allows you Tip if you're paying by credit card. You should be able to input the Tip into the total for Debit/Ideal Payments as well. Also hard to navigate and get customer support when something is wrong,"September 16, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,David Chau,Google Play Store
I'm not a fan of the extra charges outside of the delivery fee to the driver and at times I can't a refund or replacement of an item. If the driver or the restaurant messed up my order they should be held liable every single time not sometimes and then customer service reps get disrespectful trying to make it seem like you're lying to get a free meal or item. All of the issues with the fees and customer service needs to be done better as well as with more respect.,"September 2, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tifa M,Google Play Store
Efficient user-friendly app and service that has clearly been refined over its lifetime to be improved based on user feedback.

"This service is super expensive, but sometimes I don't care and don't feel like going out to get it myself so I do it anyway. I just ordered some Burger King which is like 3 or 4 miles from my house. Estimated delivery time was 20mins. But the driver who took my order was currently located in a different town. Once my cold food arrives I'm deleting the app.. Edit: Ok estimated delivery was 5:20 with latest delivery being 5:40. Food arrived at 5:23, bro must have been flying lol.

My experience has been 75 percent of time good. They need to have a way to adjust the dots on the map so the drivers will know the correct place to bring your food.

"Used this app maybe 5 times total but customer service is terrible and does not compete with other (more localised) delivery apps that I use more often. E.g. a restaurant claimed I had cancelled an order, which did not happen, I calmly explained my situation but despite informing me that this had happened 5 times THAT DAY to others, ubereats claimed they couldn't do anything about it and I would not be receiving a full refund. So money spent for nothing. I will not be using this service again.","August 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sister Oglop,Google Play Store

Absolutely horrible. Food is priced higher than the restaurants charge. You have to pay more to have your food brought right to you instead of to someone else first.

"Poor Offshore/After Hours support. I've been using this app on a weekly cadence since covid (sometimes multiple times during the week if I can double stack promos), but this last order was the final straw. I was overcharged by almost $30 and the offshore/after hours support only responded with scripted unhelpful replies.

No respect for customers time. Ordered an Indian delivery. Driver turned up with burgers. After around an hour their customer service accepted they'd made an error but we're understaffed so couldn't collect the right order. They promised to refund the cost of the order.

"Uber Eats as such is a great app - works in most major cities in the world and good UI. But a sign of warning: many restaurants are not using Uber Eats delivery, they deliver themselves or use Lieferando and often with mixed results - in Berlin so far none kept the estimated time, hard to contact them. Also no real actions taken by Uber if their drives behave rude or unprofessional. So all in all, with such end result, a potentially 5 star service becomes a 3 star service.","August 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Samuel Gustafsson,Google Play Store

"Super buggy. I've had multiple instances of the food getting delivered to the wrong house or just not appearing at all. And if it does arrive, it's a complete gamble on whether it's gonna be hot and fresh or ice cold. Also, why are people even allowed to ride bikes?

At least 40% of the time, I'm forced to drive all the way to the security entrance because the courier doesn't have a licensed vehicle or personal license.

"Uber Eats makes it so very easy to order and add special delivery, and always stands behind credits for misdelivery or missing items or poorly made food.

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it.

"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini.

Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange!

I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop.

"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

Also, many uber eats drivers phones don't actually work so you can't call them when they don't drop the order at the right place which is really painful when you've waited over an hour for the food sometimes.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,M Anonymous,Google Play Store

"Terrible AI customer service in general, yet great service from the delivery drivers so far. The restaurants and stores don't have to replace missing items or inform you. They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives. I was charged Â£67 for 2 bottles of tonic. No logic in that whatsoever. Call your bank and report them.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't. It is really that simple. just paid $44 for cold, soggy food. Not 1st time","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brenden,Google Play Store
"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store

The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store
The map used by the app has gotten worse. Initially it was off by a few feet now it gives the delivery person a complete different location for drop off.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

They have a terrible system where they just keep moving back the estimated delivery and the latest delivery, then when you try to reach support about your food being late they just say sorry. Meanwhile I'm trying to be nice and not get a refund so the restaurant doesn't take a hit for Ubers lack of service.

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store
"My order request never arrived at the restaurant. The uber app functioned as nornal, and driver quit everytime they arrived at the drive through window. Ny 5th driver decided to inform me they never received my order request. I cancelled and was charged for an order that would never have arrived. Multiple drivers were wasting their time going there.

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time.

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work. ""free"" delivery is actually more expensive than old ubereats, with all these new fees added.

"Worst food delivery app. The drivers are 5 star, the service from uber is 1. They say you can add a tip, but don't provide an option the tell you to use non existant buttons to add a tip. I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip. In app support is useless and calling them the poor agent is only give the in app text to read to me about editing the value of the tip on the non existant tip section.","January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anthony Tecchio,Google Play Store
"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money. You are forced into a situation where you don't have food and you lose your money.","November 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kristina Mckeehan,Google Play Store
"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon. That literally doesn't make sense because the customer would have to be expecting that you wouldn't honor the coupon.","December 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alivia,Google Play Store
"Usually, this app is okay but I'm getting increasingly annoyed with how many times an order has something missing or wrong. Also, they should make restaurants include food allergy warning for certain foods. I just ordered something that never specified that there was seafood in it and I had to spit it out. I just wasted my money on something that could've made me violently ill. I hardly like to complain but this is ridiculous. This app is overly pricey and most of the time not even worth it.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alondra Vidal,Google Play Store
Terrible customer service and incorrect description for groceries. I ordered clementines. The description showed 5 lbs but you had to enter the count. The grocery shopper got one based on the count. I was incorrectly charged and the agent lied saying i would receive an updated receipt within 24 hours which never occurred. When I contacted them again they said they cant issue a refund. I disputed with Paypal and won. Now the app wont let me place an order until I pay the amount back.,"November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Amy Gomanie,Google Play Store

Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem.

Example: I ordered some food with drinks. Drinks were forgotten at the restaurant. The driver refused to go back and get them.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store

The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me.

On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

The app stated the code had been successfully applied, but when I viewed my new order total, I saw that it was unchanged. I thought maybe it was an issue with the order in particular, so I started a new order just to be informed my gift code had already been redeemed. Nothing was redeemed and applied towards any order placed.","November 6, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lena Wurden (Lawwolfrox),Google Play Store
My order was stolen and cancelled. Unfortunately neither the app or webpage doesn't provide any way to start a refund process or contact the driver.

Ubereats is a great app for food ordering. Very reliable service and intuitive app. Very good customer service that is always willing to help if there are any issues with orders. I do enjoy the option to be able to have my order delivered with priority for a small fee. I also like the fact that sometimes I get an option to add on a second order and have them both delivered at the same time. Many great choices of restaurants available in the app. I've been using Ubereats for the last 3 years.,"November 9, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,REXXone REXXone,Google Play Store

You'll be charged fees for canceling an order early even though most items are out of stock which you're only told about an hour later and the delivery person hasn't left the store yet. You'll still be charged even though you've received nothing. They don't speak English & are difficult to understand. Disgusting, pathetic, & bad for business!

Uber does not(or if they do they do a terrible job) quality check the restaurants they sign on to their service. They do not allow you to speak to someone to make complaints.

"While customer service is always great, im giving this 3/5 due to repreated issues with grocery fulfillment. Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk). The level of involvement and refunding to get maybe half my order makes this app not useful at all. I wish the shoppers would just not choose grocery if they aren't able to tell lettuce from onions.","January 2, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Petra Thomas,Google Play Store

They handle customers service terribly and they make you wait 2 +hours just to find out they canceled your order. And then they don't want to refund you the money because it is an inconvenience.

"Every year when we go to Portugal for the Christmas holidays it's the same problem. It won't accept our address. There are 4 buildings side by side with different door names: 7, 7A, 7B, 7C. Each building has 26 apartments and the app refuses to accept the address ""7"", it forces the 7C automatically, making it impossible for us to order in. It's not an issue if it's for a lift, because we'd pick up the ride downstairs at the apartment building entrance.

Pretty decent delivery app. Been having issues lately though where when I pick an item I want it loads a blank screen with a button to add it to my cart. Sometimes I hit the button and it does nothing and other times it will load the screen after hitting the button because it requires a custom selection before it will add it to the cart.,"October 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jonathan Molloy,Google Play Store
"over all, great app with a nice selection of restaurants to choose from. There's deals that you can only get from the app which is a plus. The only complaint is it seems Uber Eats doesn't like to talk to the customers. There is no option to contact customer service if anything goes wrong, ( which it does every now and then). So you're just stuck with the only solution being to give the uber deliverer or store a bad review and accept you lost money.","October 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,TempuraFishcakes,Google Play Store

The driver wouldn't reply back to me and when I reached out to Uber Meagan said there was nothing they could do. I'm deleting this app and never using Uber again.

I've tried giving feedback on this multiple times, I think the food is better left in a hot place in a restaurant while we wait for another driver.

"The company is stealing money. You arent actually getting a refund when you have a missing item. Instead, they use the majority of it to tip the driver you already tipped, and then only giving you whats left over, claiming you did really get the full refund.

While trying to check the status of my order I noticed the app had placed another order to an address I have never used before and within a split second the second order had gone through.

They tried to say the food was delivered but he was at the door nobody showed up after a long wait to begin with. He was right there so no it wasn't.

Right now I'm waiting for a delivery promised in 45-60 mins, and it will arrive at least in 90 mins, but Uber called it ""on time"" until it was 25 mins late.

Before Uber One, I would get promos for 40% off for orders of minimum $15, but after I started the free trial, those promos came back in a sneaky way. 40% off for orders minimum $25. At this point I'm not saving any money if I have to order more to justify the savings. Furthermore they don't let you cancel your membership 48 hours before the next cycle, and they charge you for the next cycle early!

I tried their help, but they refused to do anything unless I could screen grab the discount code.

"Even with a membership cost is excessive; using promotions is still more than their competitors. False advertising - offers promos through notifications AND right in the app home page (!) - the promo was expired but no date shown anywhere. Customer service refused to rectify and despite my screenshots they basically insinuated that I was lying. I'm usually a nice person, but they upset me with how rude and not willing to keep a customer due to a promotional ""error"". I cancelled my membership.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sushi Comet,Google Play Store

We don't use the shop facilities. & whenever I'm in a restaurant I see the same staff dealing with Uber eats as well as everything else. I notice places like McDonald's, Burger king, Tierra burrito add 2 euros extra per item. Then add the delivery costs ( that's fine with me), service costs etc..and your meal is practically double.

The app tonight caused 3 different drivers to go to a location, the restaurant to lose their food, and for the customer to waste over 1.5 hours working with all of them to help.

"Their level of service has cratered into an abyss. Drivers can manipulate priority/express orders, taking extraordinarily out of the way routes and making other stops first, taking away the advantage of paying extra for priority/express service.

Shopper cant add items to your order so if you ordered multiple quantities of something and they only had 1, the shopper can only substitute once. So you can only get the 1 even if there are other different items available to make up for the missing quantity you needed.

Despite being a subscriber for many months, every one of my past few orders have incorrect/missing items. They now attempt to predict your address, and when you don't check it carefully enough, lies to you about whether the restaurant delivers to your house or not, forcing you to cancel your order, and then charges you 22 dollars for cancelling the order. Use a different service.","August 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jialan He,Google Play Store

"The app is okay but Uber is not an honorable company. We ordered pizza and apps. An entire pizza and calzone were both missing in the delivery. Uber eats gave me a refund for the two. The problem: we still needed food for the kids. I reordered ONE of the missing items and with fees and tip, I had to pay $6 more than what I was credited for the two missing items. So, I ended up paying more money for less food than I originally ordered. Uber refuses to make it right.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lisa Hare,Google Play Store

"You're out of luck if the order arrives past the latest arrival time, poor customer service, and the app suggests that you tip 18% on top of tax, delivery fees, and before discounts (including BOGO or anything of the sort).

After the order was delivered Uber said we had an outstanding balance, and the promo wasn't applied properly, so we went for help. The CSR's were AWFUL.

Uber service is not the best anymore. There are so many issues especially with the delivery. The driver keeps on changing. Sometimes the driver shows staying with the order at one place and when you message them they won't reply even if they see the message. At one point they just literally threw the food and ran away.

I've had quite a few orders with missing items, probably more times than not, but customers services always refund me for it, which is good, but sort of defeats the point of ordering on the app, if I then need to go out to buy the missing items...

"The app is great, but you guys need to do a better job of prioritizing restaurants based on delivery addresses. If I order from a restaurant chain that has one location 5 miles away, and another 15, it would make sense to flag the 5 mile one first, since the app auto selects the location when setting an order. Maybe this is your way of getting a few extra dollars off us (seeing how you will charge us for the price when canceling or more to pay, due to distance), but let's be fair about this.","August 11, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Matt Gray,Google Play Store

It is easy to contact support about an order being messed up, which is probably the most important, but if you need something else there is almost no way. The amount of coupons available of you have Uber 1 or whatever it's called is actually crazy to me.

As it stands in 2023, drivers are using multiple gig apps to pick and choose their work. If you are one of the unlucky ones, they will cancel your order and do something else.

But once order is delivered, it asks again if you want to give Tip - even if you had selected to Not Tip earlier. This is bad but still ok. Real problem starts when you select Don't Tip this time, close the app & reopen it.

"Horrendous customer service! I've had numerous problems. Orders are never correct, and if you adjust the tip, they will attempt to charge you an incorrect amount unless you add to it. Uber cash is a lie. You must dispute with your bank, and they will fix it. So, they wrongfully placed an outstanding balance on my UE account. They falsely claimed I had to pay to fix it. I did not, but they fixed it. I reached out to support. Now I can't complete orders. Two days, no special support, as claimed.","September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Matt Campbell,Google Play Store
"Absolutely horrendous company. I will have to make a complaint, I did try to reach them out but there's NOWHERE to do so. I tried to issue an order and they didn't have some of the items I have requested. Then it was said: add items with other shops. I tried to add 3 bunch of bananas with 40% included. Not only I was charged 9 pounds in total for that alone, I also COULDN'T CANCEL THE ORDER. Nowhere said to cancel it and I kept on trying. Very low.","August 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Luciana B,Google Play Store
I understand that fraud is probably rampant but it's super frustrating that 80 percent of our orders is missing an item or made incorrectly and they have a limit to how many times they will make something right for you. You end up paying for something you didn't get and that's really annoying. We aren't picky at all we just genuinely don't eat the things we ask for.,"August 26, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Keith Evans,Google Play Store

The first time i placed a order the $25 was refunded to me for my second order the promo code wasn't working BEFORE I placed my order I contacted support to tell them my promo code was disappearing at check out the agent told me to place the order anyway then contact support for another refund.

"Functions quite well the majority of the time. Three reasons I've not given 5 stars (these things don't happen very often, but at a high enough frequency to cause annoyance): 1) The map to track your driver is occasionally inaccurate 2) The app will randomly refresh/go back to the homepage when you are looking through a menu or searching for restaurants 3) The delivery fee displayed in the restaurant summary can sometimes be different to the actual delivery fee at checkout","September 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Viresh Mistry,Google Play Store

I contacted them this time because I had cancelled an order and had not been refunded. They replied that I'd had to contact them to get a refund for an order I'd cancelled, so I hadn't received my order or my money.

Have had really bad experience with Uber eats....if an order can't be filled because they are out of what the customer wants Uber eats should not charge the customer first before knowing this!

"I've had a very frustrating experience which seems to be a fairly regular occurrence at this point. My delivery person just stops in one place or goes the opposite direction of the actual restaurant. They then waste 10-15 minutes before ""opting out"" of the order as customer support called it. It's happened where I've had at least 3 drivers/riders assigned to the same order after the previous one has opted out. Absolutely unacceptable.

The sneaky RATS will send you promotions that aren't valid or just refuse to complete the order, which is a nightmare to begin with as the app is unresponsive and full of bugs.

The ""priority"" option is complete bs, pay extra for faster delivery and most of the time it still takes longer than the time it advertises.

App itself never fails. Good and easy to order. Only problem we have is human error when it comes to the orders. Every other other is missing items or its a completely different order.

If you try to get help about a restaurant more than a few times, they will flag it and won't give you a refund. I can understand for a security measure. I can't help if some places mess up","October 10, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Alexis caton,Google Play Store

"Only slightly better than Door Dash. The drivers still miss entire food items to be included and /or order notes. Sometimes it's not even the person or car listed. They have their eyes on the next delivery while they are still working on yours, but what can you expect when there is no actual hiring process? Good customer service is a thing of the past so for now I'll just lower my expectations (and the tip) when things don't go correctly.","September 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jessica Tisdale,Google Play Store
"App convenient, but needs work. The website was atrocious, so I switched to the app instead, and while I am annoyed that there are SO many push notifications, it's ultimately way better than the website.

"Customer services is a joke, I'm still awaiting contact on a food order I received that was freezing and uncooked 6m ago. But the worst is the amount of promo emails and none of them ever work. Going to be stopping using this app, delivery fees push you to join uber one (or whatever its called) food always ends up costing double than going into the shop to actually order.

Good restaurants great low service fees!! but the food takes a while to get to you and delivery times can change.

Very expensive mind you, but it's better than Just Eat which has the habit of losing your orders (losing them completely ""accidentally"" into the mouths of the delivery drivers, hmm...) . With uber eats you can see where the driver is on the map the whole time, so they can't scarper off with your scran. I've never not had an order delivered, with Uber Eats.

"Not only are they charging over twice the price (tacos are $2.25. Thru the app, they're $4.75.) They also charge like $9 because of ""order size"" , but none of it goes to the driver. So why is the food double the price, and why charge damn near $10 for my order size? The order size charge is supposedly because it takes up room in the uber, but half the time my order is the only one that got picked up (the app shows if there's another before yours).","September 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Junior,Google Play Store

The worst food delivery app ever. They just scam people and don't provide and help if there's a problem with your order. Definitely not worth the subscription fees.

You have to pay for the convenience with a few extra fees, such as service fees and delivery fees, and honestly the couriers deserve a fair tip.

"Every time I try it it's because I forgot how treacherous it is. Also this time, after not having used it for 4 years, it does not disappoint on the abysmal level of delivery time management and poor level of communication.

Overall app is great but there is some points need to improve like most of the restaurants don't update their menu's sometimes when we order something it cancelled the order at the last minute saying some excuses it's better to update the menu before we order and wait until they cancelle order at the last moment. And if we order something and it's started raining we know it's dificult to deliver the order in that case we should have a option to contact with someone and took the deliver directly,"October 11, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Gihan Himasha,Google Play Store
"If you have an issue and need help with the past (non ongoing) order, it is impossible to get help. If you try to call to the customer service line, they would not answer and direct you back to the Uber Eats app, because you do not have an ongoing order. However, the app is useless as you cannot get through to the customer service team either. The options of the issue that you need to choose from are not the ones I am experiencing. In the end, you get stuck and cannot do anything about it.","September 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Julius Semenas,Google Play Store
"Horrible service, they are literally stealing money from customers. Paid for priority delivery, took over 40 minutes (store was just 7 minutes away from my address), no driver and they kept pushing expected arrival time 5 minutes later every 5 minutes. When I canceled, they charged me over $12 (order was only $10 + fees and priority delivery fee totaled $20) This company is constantly losing money so the only way they can make up those loses is by scamming their customers now.","October 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Helmand Alekozai,Google Play Store
"I was charged incorrectly on my order as well as receiving the wrong size drink, I complained and they said they would refund the 7.49 delivery fee that was meant to be free and refund 2.20 for the drink. What they actually did was refund 7.49 and then charge me 5.29. Obviously their system can't handle adding a second refund.

"Since they launched Uber One (I am not subscribed) the service has deteriorated. Without offers the delivery and service charge are massive compared to their rivals. Their drivers now make multiple stops on the way, often this is when they are due to deliver my food so they are clearly doing jobs for other firms at the same time as you can see them driving to restraints miles away leaving my order late.

"Bait and switch. Uber was good for a couple months. Now that I've used them A LOT they have started to take advantage of me. I've used their rides and food delivery frequently lately.

"Only use this app if you have money and time. And by time, I mean HOURS. The reason why I say this is because the app is obviously not aware of how long the order takes. It does apologize for the 'inconvenience' yet offers no free option to cancel and order something else, even if it takes hours. I placed an order for a restaurant right down the street from the delivery address, and it took 3 hours for arrival. This app has no time limits, so if you're a diabetic, or ordering at work.

First I never received my food once and the picture they sent me was of a totally different house. I couldn't contact the driver for 10 minutes so non-stop trying.

"Uber eats is great. The fact that you can have pretty much whatever food you want whenever you want it delivered to your home is a game changer.

"If you live in a military base, orders are a gamble. They don't warn delivery drivers that the order is on base until after they pick up an order. If the driver doesn't have a pass, they're likely to pick up your order, drive to the gate, and get turned around, then cancel it because they're dumb enough to think they'll be allowed on just because they work for Uber.

Uber eats it's a great app overall but sometimes you may experience poor customer service from Uber drivers which has nothing to do with the ubereats app itself .

Why would you tip when the driver simply takes it a short A to B and they have already charged you twice? Thirdly, when there is an issue you can't get help or complain properly, you have to go by their suggestions.

I'd prefer a ""your order will arrive between x and y time"" so I'm not waiting for an order while I could be doing other things with my time. I order from here when the resto isn't on Doordash. Skip and Ritual are better than this, too.","October 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Priyanka Chowdhury,Google Play Store
"Appalling customer service. Refund process is flawed/restrictive. They will not refund you for anything other than the bare minimum (the exact price of any missing/damaged items) and will not refund for the inconvenience or poor experience. Zero flexibility/not willing to provide compensation. If this were another sector or business, you would be offered a goodwill gesture as an apology. Awful.

"Update. I gave them another chance, even ended up paying for the uber one service. You pay for this service, but if you want your food delivered hot, even warm, you need to pay even more now for priority delivery.

Then if you consistently have issues, uber will caution you no matter how much documentation you can provide. The drivers picture can show no drinks and they will still give you the ""you're impacting the restaurant.""

"Uber Eats as such is a great app - works in most major cities in the world and good UI. But a sign of warning: many restaurants are not using Uber Eats delivery, they deliver themselves or use Lieferando and often with mixed results - in Berlin so far none kept the estimated time, hard to contact them. Also no real actions taken by Uber if their drives behave rude or unprofessional. So all in all, with such end result, a potentially 5 star service becomes a 3 star service.","August 1, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Samuel Gustafsson,Google Play Store
"This is a pretty nice app to have, granted twice i've had missing items from orders, but they have been amazing when it comes to that!

"Super buggy. I've had multiple instances of the food getting delivered to the wrong house or just not appearing at all. And if it does arrive, it's a complete gamble on whether it's gonna be hot and fresh or ice cold. Also, why are people even allowed to ride bikes? You almost guarantee you're gonna get it cold when they're on a bike, and god forbid it's storming while they're bringing it (which has happened to me).","September 22, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Mountain,Google Play Store
"Uber eats used to be the best. Now it's just as bad as all the others. Over priced, bad delivery drivers, and incredibly poor customer service. Recently, I've had damaged food, cold food, missing food; and Uber eats does nothing about it. They only tell you ""this order isn't eligible for a refund"" no matter the issue. I recently had to dispute a charge because my order was missing items and they refused to refund me for them. Now they're trying to force that money back from me. DON'T DL THIS APP","August 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Britney Liedtke,Google Play Store
I wish I did not get the annual plan. The service on door dash is way better.

"I've had a consistent uber deliverer for a bit now and he told me that when him and his friend uber together, they'll 'switch' orders or something so he can give me my food it's borderline sweet and annoying - I just want my food, but then he does his best to make conversation with me when I gotta get back to work ð I use it almost everyday when I'm at work and most to all drivers have been good with keeping the food the right temperature - when it's cold or the drinks are warm, it sucks","September 13, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Destiny Ramirez,Google Play Store

"Total terrible. I was charged for an order that never arrived. I contacted the restaurant to see when it was picked up, and they confirmed that no one collected the order. When I tried to contact uber eats, is no support, only a message from the ""help"" informing me that if they can not deliver, you will be charged. This was my 1st encounter with Uber eats and will be my last. I organised this order on behalf of my husband, who had become ill on a business trip and was unable to drive.

"I am a regular user of Uber food delivery and rides. I've been a perfect customer, never causing trouble. Yesterday I placed a delivery order to my friend's place because I was going over for dinner. The driver sent us the wrong order, from the wrong restaurant, with the wrong name on it, and said the wrong company (SkipTheDishes). It took me many hours, two days, and many repeated messages back and forth to finally get a refund for the 25% tip. I plan to quit using Uber.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Chen,Google Play Store
"This app is only as good as its couriers. I live in a complex with a security boom that requires vehicles entering to have a valid driver's and car license, two things that any law abiding citizen should be able to produce while in their vehicle. At least 40% of the time, I'm forced to drive all the way to the security entrance because the courier doesn't have a licensed vehicle or personal license. Uber fails to vet their drivers and allows their food to be delivered ILLEGALLY. Not good enough.","August 24, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ric Shields,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats makes it so very easy to order and add special delivery, and always stands behind credits for misdelivery or missing items or poorly made food. There aren't always ordering options I'd like but that's the fault/responsibility of the Restaurant.

Feedback needs to be an option on the app for customers especially for each restaurants. I wanted to post a feedback for the firehouse subs menu requesting more customization options.

"I love the promotions that they always offer me and the various restaurants that offer buy one get one free menu items. That in conjunction with the Uber One membership, which slashes off a few dollars from the order total, makes ordering food on Uber Eats worth it!

"I've been using the service for a couple years now. Last week I experienced an overcharge from Chipotle. I contacted Uber Eats to rectify the manner as requested. 2 days go by, giving me this list of information they need to issue of $4 refund. As most Americans do, this is too much of a hassle to bother to get $4 back. They do this, I feel purposely to not have to issue these small refunds. Thus would go into a surplus account. I've deleted my app.","August 26, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Danelle Lucado,Google Play Store
"After placing an order it just dissappears. You have no way of tracking it. This caused me to duplicate my order and get charged twice.

App needs some serious improvements.","August 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brendt Wooi,Google Play Store
"They do not correct issues or give refunds. They make mistakes and let you pay for it. They are late and serve cold food and still make you pay full price. They have horrible communication and just ignore the chats you send and send the same message whenever you have a problem....""we complement understand however you do not qualify for a refund"". We are not valued customers instead we are just order #s. Thus company only cares about money.","September 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TheMegz296,Google Play Store

I take the picture, explained what was ordered and what I got instead, and try to figure things out. The customer service is terrible. I point blank asked twice why they won't give a refund and they thanked me for my understanding. I wouldn't have cared if it was just the app credit or something along those lines. But they don't care about quality.","August 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nakiiya Gore,Google Play Store

"These guys really went downhill quick, the service is constantly delayed, changing drivers , sending someone on a bicycle who is 5 miles away. No drinks with the order, food made completely wrong and they only want to refund you a quarter of it. Their technology all of a sudden magically sucks too.

Was charged for an order i canceled within seconds of submitting it incorrectly and wasnt told that it failed to cancel through the app, i was only told after i was charged via an email so i ended up ordering twice and paying twice.

"Accidentally ordered at the wrong restaurant for a pick up and the customer service I received was awful. I have one major recommendation, be able to change from pick up orders to delivery. The customer service rep I had also was trying to charge me a cancelation fee for my order? WHO would cancel an order just to get charged extra?

"Their driver dropped our food outside our house and none of it could be saved (it was raining and the food got soaked). Uber swiftly canceled our order, which was nice I guess, but we would have preferred to have it remade and redelivered. We went to order it again and now they want a $19.99 delivery fee, when before it was only $2.49. What a low blow attempt to make back their lost money. I went to order it again anyway and now it says the restaurant is too far away. Do better Uber.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Judah Romano,Google Play Store

"If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Uber eats has gone downhill. Customer service is a joke. If you don't receive part of your order, customer service barely responds, and you absolutely won't get a refund for the missing items. So essentially, Uber eats steals from you, the customer.

The app itself works fine, but overall, about 1 out of every 3 orders I have made in the last year contained either wrong or missing items. That is a 33% error rate overall. Disappointed overall. And then insult to injury - Uber Eats sends me an email stating ""It looks like youâve recently made several refund requestsâmany more than most other customers"". You're dam right I have!

One of the items delivered was incorrect, as a substitution had been made due to the item being out of stock. I was not made aware beforehand and my consent was not given for the product switch. I asked for a refund from Uber Eats for that one item and was repeatedly denied, with no logical rationale. They have lost a customer over approximately $7.","August 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Donna Chase,Google Play Store
"Went back to Uber eats because they keep sending me offers and thought to give them a second chance but they haven't changed at all no customer service available, the promo codes are mostly invalid for some reason, NOT EXPIRED, that's why I went to Skip they have amazing 24/7 customer service and its very fast.

They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour. By the time I was able to contact support, it had already arrived luke warm.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel L,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store

When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost Â£7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store

I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to.

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold).

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee?

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Worse delivery app and service ever coming from someone who has used it for years. Despite having multiple issues the only help you'll ever receive is from automated responses that didn't even read your message or address it before closing it. The delivery estimate is always wrong and usually adjusted 3x before actually en route. Overpriced and less reliable compared to other apps with huge emphasis on HORRIBLE customer support. My experience was so bad I completely deleted my account and app.,"January 8, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kenton Tran,Google Play Store
The support pages in the app are absolutely abysmal to try and navigate. I hope for the same of your sanity you never have an issue. The fees are getting less concise and predictable.

It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived? Service fee hikes in price when you get deals/promos.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,rin kagamine,Google Play Store

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet.

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item. So it's just not fair for them to rebuke our right to refund just because we requested it in past orders.","November 13, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jadeyeyeyeyey,Google Play Store

All they were able to say is 'sorry, no refund' !

I use it for grocery delivery a fair amount, which helps me a lot for heavy items.

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

They do groceries too.,"January 16, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Kimberly McCoy,Google Play Store
"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie NegrÃµn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order. I have asked for more refunds and cancelled orders in the last month than i have in the entire year. Thoroughly upset,"December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan G,Google Play Store
"The most useless delivery service app and the worst customer experience I've ever had.

"Placed an order and waited an hour until my order was cancelled by the app so no reason at all, I called the restaurant and they told me the driver had already picked up my order before it got cancelled.

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store
"Uber is complete trash, I ordered a burger meal, both burgers are supposed to come with 2 paddies, all of them were missing.

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store
The map used by the app has gotten worse. Initially it was off by a few feet now it gives the delivery person a complete different location for drop off.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

"Discounts mean basically nothing. 20% discounts up to $20 means you have to spend more than $50 to get the full $20 off. Feels slimy. Not to mention the poor customer service at times. Making the report system confusing is annoying, and unfair to users. Also, the refreshing at random is awful.

"If i could give less than 1 star, i would. Uber one never works for free delivery or promotions consistently so uber one is definitely not worth $9.99 when im only ordering out like once a week. The promotions i was getting were also getting worse before i stopped getting them completely, for example i used to have 5 orders per coupon, then it was only 1 per coupon. I also received sketchy charges labeled ""uber pass toronto"" to a card that was never linked to my uber account.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dee Mason,Google Play Store

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that.

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip.

"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money.

"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon.

Also, they should make restaurants include food allergy warning for certain foods. I just ordered something that never specified that there was seafood in it and I had to spit it out.

I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

Highly DO NOT recommend","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,heather berboth,Google Play Store
They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless. An order arrived freezing cold and a week later all they said was that the items matched what I ordered. Disgusting.,"December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ariel Hope,Google Play Store
"Got a very poor food service from a uber eats restaurant, it was supposed to be a submelt but the paper came stuck on the bread, ordered as well some cheese bites which was from days ago or you could see the dryness. Requested a refund, and got previous refunds for much less hassle, and didn't get it! Very poor customer service overall from that experience.

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

I use Uber one to help with those fees and, in some cases, still can be $4 for ""taxes and fees"" on a $20 order.

If you don't set your delivery address before you order,if you order from different locations,and it goes to the wrong address they will not correct it only giving you a 50% discount.

"Your order is on the way. Your driver has some stops on the way (even though you pay for Uber One). Then you notice that the reason it's taking for ever is that the delivery prior is way out of your way from the restaurant. Even passing your location to get to the other order. Trying to talk to someone you get the, unfortunately now too common, 'AI' chat bot. Seriously, this is the worst. I don't blame the driver. It's this ridiculous app and policies.

You can't even give a bad rating to the drivers that cancelled. The help chat is no help, they just waste your time and tell you your driver is close to the restaurant... and then it gets collected 30mins later!

It works but its certainly not perfect. Ordering food items is the easy part. It's the waiting to see what arrives. It's 70/30 whether you received what your ordered.

"Not using again, they just remove items offyour order if they want and since you are obviously ordering what you need then it makes the whole service charge and tip pointless since you need to go and get them yourself.

Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk).

Uber Eats offers coupons and promos (unlike DD) and every experience for no contact drop off is done quickly, efficiently, and without any hassle. The app is smooth & has a nice user experience. Thus far, Uber One is well worth it, but we'll see. There are still significantly less restaurants/stores on Uber Eats vs DD in my area, but if they keep expanding, I'll switch permanently.

Pretty easy to use and really really good discounts on certain dishes from certain restaurants (BOGO) ð it makes me a little sad that some restaurants with free delivery on DD don't have that on Uber Eats, but that's not a big deal.

Here are some tips when using Uber Eats: 1) You have 10 minutes after you place your order to add an additional order at another restaurant while your primary (first) order is being prepared.

But be sure to track the orders, and if the same driver is making both deliveries. 2) When rating your order and driver be sure NOT to tip unless you want to give the driver more than what you originally agreed.","December 12, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,E.

Bad customer service. They have a lifetime refund limit and will just stop refunding missing or cancelled orders. I was charged twice for 1 order and they refuse to refund me. It just feels illegal. The customer service only makes matters worse and almost try to guilt trip you. I've used uber eats for years and I actively avoid reviewing things.

"Misleading information regarding arrivals. When choosing a restaurant with, for example, 20 minutes of estimate arrival, it takes as much as twice or the triple of the time (40 to 60 minutes) When the courier is heading its way to deliver the food, regardless of having other stops, the ""latest arrival"" is constantly updating to a longer time.

Uber eats have become the worst. You cannot even get decent support when your order is delayed so much that you can see it is not coming. Orders change status to complete when nothing has arrived and you have to fight to get refunds even after they tell you it has been refunded.

The driver is not responsive and there is no support on the app. This is my second order in the space of less than a month like this.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chandini Wentzel,Google Play Store

My go to food delivery app. I like being able to modify tips as I have had bad experiences with other delivery apps where you can't.

I ordered food from the app. One of the items didn't arrive. I told Uber about this and the only thing they sent me was a boilerplate answer saying that I couldn't be refunded. Tried to understand why but they wouldn't tell me. I tried to explain that they messed up with my order and made a customer lose money. Unfortunately the same boilerplate answer came time and time again. Maybe it's time to give Uber's competition a shot.,"December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Henrique Figueiredo,Google Play Store

Generally very convenient. Sometimes food is left uncollected from the restaurant for over half an hour and this makes it inedible by the time it gets to my door - usually the complaints department is relatively reasonable...

I could see the driver was sitting at the restaurant waiting for my order and then they cancelled it my order. A chat window came up to discuss and the person on the other end didn't respond at all and that was over 20 min ago.

Customer service have gone downhill. Its like they don't care anymore. I have ordered a lot from here & when there are problems I report it & they would ask for proof and refund. I've been using the app for over 5 yrs & now all I get is a message saying that my account has had a lot of refunds/ adjustments so now I don't get anything. I have emailed them with numerous photos as proof & nothing. They make it out like they can't trust me even with proof. I've had enough now.

I will say they are great if you order something that's not really that important because they are not reliable nor communicative.

Unsafe and inconvenient. The maps has been incorrect for years now and it puts the drivers on the other side of the highway instead of at my address. The app also does not give me the option to deny bicycle delivery. I live by a highway and it is a major safety issue for people to bike here.

At this point I'm not saving any money if I have to order more to justify the savings.

"I have been using this app for some time now, and a few things have changed in the last year that have made me change my review to 1 star. The first thing is the price hike. I'm not sure how a $40 order turns in a $75 order before tip without me adding anything to my basket. The second thing is the fact that for the last 3 months, I have not received a correct order. The orders are either missing multiple items, completely wrong, or dropped off at the wrong house.","December 31, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Austin CRAIG,Google Play Store

Even ordering from a fast food restaurant where everything is set up to be as straightforward and simple as possible. Uber Eats manages to make delivery more inconvenient then getting it yourself.

Charged for food that was never picked up and estimated delivery time got pushed back for over an hour before the order cancelled, by which time McDonalds was closing and so couldnt help.

It is highly deceptive.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terry Sangster,Google Play Store

Took them 4days to look at all issues and it's now our fault for not reporting the issue in 48 hrs so no refund. Never again not worth the risk.

Someone else had to which caused it to be late, but I don't think it's right to give them a bad rating or take their tip away for the other person not following through, so I requested that that person not be allowed to accept my order anymore due to the issue that arises.

Every time we have an issue with Uber Eats the refund and inconvenience has never been equivalent to the amount needed to make it right. This has happened on several occasions but in this instance (which is the reason I deleted the app and will not use them again) is that we ordered a $15.00 combo from a fast food restaurant and the combo was missing an item.

Despite being a subscriber for many months, every one of my past few orders have incorrect/missing items. They now attempt to predict your address, and when you don't check it carefully enough, lies to you about whether the restaurant delivers to your house or not, forcing you to cancel your order, and then charges you 22 dollars for cancelling the order.

The problem: we still needed food for the kids. I reordered ONE of the missing items and with fees and tip, I had to pay $6 more than what I was credited for the two missing items. So, I ended up paying more money for less food than I originally ordered. Uber refuses to make it right.","October 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lisa Hare,Google Play Store

"The app is great, but you guys need to do a better job of prioritizing restaurants based on delivery addresses. If I order from a restaurant chain that has one location 5 miles away, and another 15, it would make sense to flag the 5 mile one first, since the app auto selects the location when setting an order.

Very badly implemented.","August 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jayson Kent,Google Play Store
"First off, the fact that the only coupons I ever get anymore are for ""groceries"" is useless. I never use them, stop giving them to me. Secondly, having no option to request utensils or add notes to an order for many places. This results in multiple times where I get no straw or utensils for something that is too messy without them. The convenience is slowly starting to be outweighed by how useless the app actually is.","September 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reza CatThing,Google Play Store

"The promos are misleading af. '20% off' ends up being (no joke) 81p on a Â£21 bill with all the charges. Don't waste your time trying to get it to the minimum spend, just order what you want, it'll come out to less without the 'promo'. The delivery fee is also intentionally misleading, as they only show the Uber One price and not the actual cost. The drivers are great & doing their best, but of course Uber guilts you into tipping after all other charges, instead of just paying them enough.","August 25, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Siobhan H,Google Play Store
"Terrible customer service. It's not the first time that delivery person ""fakes"" being lost and not finding the address in order for the order to be cancelled. They take forever to deliver the order... make calls just to make it seem as they contacted the person...And the funny thing is there is no way the app allows a user to report that kind of suspicious action.

"Customer support is awful. Unless your issue is super basic and simple, it won't get solved. They don't care or trust their customers, when in doubt they will just ignore you and keep your money. I recommend using any other delivery app. The app has some bugs and glitches that get annoying in the long run. There are also some non-intuitive behaviors that I suspect are left there to have you make a mistake and miss offers or pay their premium subscription for longer than intended.","September 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lorenzo Leal,Google Play Store

That was after two requests for a different delivery person, being hung up on and telling me I can not cancel without being charged.

Almost every other time I try and use Uber eats I end up getting told that for some reason my order can't be delivered as soon as I go to pay.

Uber cash is a lie. You must dispute with your bank, and they will fix it. So, they wrongfully placed an outstanding balance on my UE account. They falsely claimed I had to pay to fix it. I did not, but they fixed it. I reached out to support. Now I can't complete orders.

I understand that fraud is probably rampant but it's super frustrating that 80 percent of our orders is missing an item or made incorrectly and they have a limit to how many times they will make something right for you.

They replied that I'd had to contact them to get a refund for an order I'd cancelled, so I hadn't received my order or my money.

App is very glitchy and drivers can do multiple order deliveries so food is always cold. When you have to deal with the customer service team you just get passed around from team to team while they try and figure out what's going on. Can't recommend the service.

Why should I keep using your app when you let your driver's sxam us and take our food and then don't allow us to get a refund? I didn't even get half my food and the app told me I wasn't eligible for a refund even though some of my recent orders had issues too. So I wastes money on getting half my order.

I spend alot of $$ w Uber and Uber eats and I wish there customer service was better because how am I not eligible for a refund when I didn't even receive my order when the delivery person brought the incorrect order.,"December 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lacey Hall,Google Play Store
More options then door dash and great promotions. The fact that I can order from Costco is a game changer.

I really don't recommend to use its not like hot it used to be. They charge extra and will remove items and mess the whole order up. If they don't have a certain item they should replace it with something or it should be registered before it allows me to order which also resulted in me losing the promo code discount.

"Edit: Used it for the first time in the US, and the app was really struggling to work. The restaurant I wanted to order from said we were too far away for delivery, even though we were 3 miles away. The address next door to the restaurant even said it was too far to deliver. Then I entered an address FARTHER away, in another city, and the delivery was available. So I drove to go meet the driver bc we were using a promo for delivery only. Then taxes and fees still made dinner $20.

Extremely greedy company. They pay their employees little to nothing and rely on customers to pay their salary. They also steal from their customers. I had a delivery driver steal my food and Uber (their only customer service is the in-app chat in which agents copy and paste the same responses word for word over and over again) refused to give me a refund. I had to file with my bank to issue a chargeback. Will be going to GrubHub. Never again.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sarah Gaestel,Google Play Store
Uber Eats is the least dependable delivery service available. They are never on time if they even show up with your order at all.

The wrong address was put in for me despite forcing me to allow permission for my location. So after one minute of ordering, I tried to update my delivery address. The app said my address was too far away despite it only being 4 miles away.

"Very scummy implementation of promotional offers. It advertises promotional offers to entice you to sign up or fill a basket for an order and then the promotions become unredeemable. Free trial emails that take you to a ""Try Now"" button where the small print says it'll charge you. Promotional offers that say all nearby stores or restaurants are ineligible when you try to actually apply them.

So why is the food double the price, and why charge damn near $10 for my order size?
