"Edit: they brought the feature back! Used to be amazing, but they just got rid of their best feature, the ability to search for dishes. You used to be able to search for a specific dish and find everyone who makes that dish and delivers to you and how much they charge. Now it's just a mediocre delivery app... why would you get rid of this feature???","January 18, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Rufus Wright,Google Play Store
"Lately it's very common to wait over 2 hours for the food, while the order is passed on to 3 or 4 drivers before one finally cancels. What in the world is wrong with this app? If more than one driver passes on, it should auto cancel. Otherwise I'm waiting for food that I'm not sure if it will arrive, and then it never does. Literally not rendering the service. Happens constantly. HUGE problem. System needs a change.","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bastian H,Google Play Store
"Very disappointed in this app. I've used it for a long time but the service fees keep increasing, sometimes up to $20 extra for a small 10 items order. Also, as I'm adding to my cart for promotions, the promotion disappears. Lastly, the prices for items are often higher than in store. Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible. Drivers also seem to be rarely checked out by uber (different person turns up to who is registered) so security/safety issues. Some of the drivers are also pretty rubbish and constantly cancel once they accept leaving you waiting for ages for another delivery person and food then turns up cold.,"January 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,broomee c,Google Play Store
Don't like the fact u can't get a refund unless u take a picture and it takes a second for u to be able to rate so u can go back to ur receipt and say something is wrong by then my foods cold. I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt. I thinking the rating part should activate right after the order is completed and in the ratings be able to say if something was missing or not. Besides that it's great,"January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Teresa Anderson,Google Play Store
"Awful application. Use Glovo instead if you have it. No chat function with support is provided. I ordered food, received a bank withdrawal, saw that the order had been created, and then confirmed. Ten minutes later, it's just disappeared, and while getting help within limited application options, I came across a mandatory order to choose in order to proceed to report my issue. Of course, I couldn't do that because my order just disappeared, and there were no hinting notifications.","January 19, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is Tomas,Google Play Store
"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification. I order the same things but they never look the same or miss items more and more, the quality of food is definitely decreasing while the prices keep rising.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sahra O,Google Play Store
"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants. After years of being a loyal customer, it still doesn't get what I like and don't! Too expensive for absolutely no reason.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ishak Al Khatib,Google Play Store
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store
"I placed a takeaway order on UberEats and the status page showed that I can add items from grocery stores for no delivery fee. I decided to give that a go and added some items from Co-Op. When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost £7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store
"Horrible I had an uber 1, trial & when it came time to cancel. I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to. And that was days after the trial period was over and was expected to pay for the subscription, I never used the benefits of the subscription 1 single time.","January 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,james Linge,Google Play Store
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store
"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store
"Overpriced and misleading app. Got an email that said "" get 60% off your order as a welcome back"" so I decided to order for once. Clicked the email link, it opened the app, took me to the restaraunts that accepted this offer. I get to checkout and the discount does not apply. Spent 20 minutes trying to find a way to apply the discount, but there was no where in the options for it. Following that, the order was incorrect and cold. Unacceptable. Uber died and its corpse delivers disappointment","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Zane Elliott,Google Play Store
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store
"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store
"Update: bug has been fixed. On another note, to uber eats drivers. Stop leaving the food in front of doors. The majority of front doors open outwards. Meaning that food gets ruined or can't be access easily because it is blocking the door's ability to open. ~ App seems to have a bug. When I click on an item the screen goes blank and I can't order any food.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"This company will scam you in any way possible. I had two promotions applied to my order before I placed it, and neither one applied after I paid. They charged me full price. I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store
"Mysterious disappearing promotions. Looks like a promotion, you click on it and it disappears, or your order gets rejected and the promotion disappears. Customer services are obsessed with screenshots of disappeared promotions because they clearly don't understand the concept of disappeared... Used to function and offer good promotions, now not worth it.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,N H,Google Play Store
"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12. It's basically for ""emergencies"" when you're in a city overnight for a layover, but that's about it. But otherwise, love it!","November 17, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lisa Coester,Google Play Store
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini. What a scam!","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,anthonio j,Google Play Store
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available 😒. I got charged over £6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available. I'm an Uber one customer, but I'm really thinking of deleting the app. Total rip-off money in delivery fees.

Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes.

"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange!

"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store
"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store
"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3. Certain restaurants get un-favorited every day for some reason. Even after adding back they don't appear in my faves.","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jeremy B,Google Play Store
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart. Based on recent reviews in the Play Store, it seems others are having a similar issue.

Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour.

Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault.

Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"". Finally asked them to cancel my Uber One subscription, they closed the chat saying we cannot do anything.

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me. This is clearly a setting on the app but sucks and usually sends the carrier far away from my location, is not something on the same route but a total detour. Now my food is always cold or not appetizing.","November 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Richie Crotin,Google Play Store

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

For example they will give me 30% 40% 50% off, all of them are the same ""up to £12 off"" and they don't work for most restaurants. The service/delivery fee is also very high compared to other apps. I don't see why order from here when you could use Deliveroo instead which is cheaper, has a better service and better restaurants. Ordering from Deliveroo without discount is cheaper than Uber Eats with 30% off.","November 5, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ioana Belu,Google Play Store

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up. If you refuse their subscription, they purposely overcharge, and there is no real breakdown of who gets the service charge money.","December 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia White,Google Play Store

"Was loving the app so I got Uber One and since then it's been nothing but problems, I keep getting promos sent to me via email but when I try to claim them in app they won't work and the support tells you to just place the order and reach back out after for a refund but if you do it that way it takes almost a hour with support and it's liking pulling teeth to get the refund for the promo amount and then they often just give you credit instead.

"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store

I immediately contacted customer support upon receiving my order to explain. After days of waiting they denied me a refund without explanation or rationale. Despite my previous order history of ordering the exact same items from the same place, they were not interested in investigating the app error.

"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item.

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing? Also, they mainly give discounts or promo things for rides and I mainly use this for ordering food. I might check out other food apps and see if there's something better.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,pinky1234567,Google Play Store
"Terrible they cancelled my order and charged me for it. It is impossible to resolve this issue through the app and customer service is virtually non existent. The do not respond to Facebook. X, or the website. When you call customer service the only option is for rider's and current orders. When I choose rider option to talk to a person they are rude and send you in a loop back to the app. I can prove they cancelled and I payed but they completely ignore me.

Worst app ever. Don't waste your time or money. This place offers several good promotions but when you try and use them they don't work. I've had this happen 3 times and when you speak to any csr they are rude and have to transfer you about 3 times only to tell you someone will reach out in 3-6 business days.

I got there trial membership. I was told I had until the 2nd. But they charged me on the 1st. Of course in the fine print it says I can't cancel within 48 hours of the renewal. Says I have to contact them for help. I can't find anywhere to talk to anyone on the app. Also it says nothing is refundable. So I was already charged ahead of the renewal date and stuck with it.

"The constant reminder to tip drivers when a) I've chosen not to tip them purposefully for various reasons. b) I ordered using priority delivery, thereby paying for delivery. It's patronising to have to he reminded 100 times. There are MANY negative things about Uber Eats and very FEW positives. Uber One is a savings but only by a smidge. There are no exclusive deals. In fact, many others get better deals in the same area and location. Customer retention needs a serious revisit!","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,D G,Google Play Store
"Prices are deceptive. They will raise the price of an item at a restaurant, and then give you a ""discount."" So the delivery fee is always high but hidden. Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself.

Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed.

"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price.

Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months.

Ten minutes later, it's just disappeared, and while getting help within limited application options, I came across a mandatory order to choose in order to proceed to report my issue. Of course, I couldn't do that because my order just disappeared, and there were no hinting notifications.","January 19, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is Tomas,Google Play Store
"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification.

"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants.

We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"".

When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost £7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store

I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to.

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food.

At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly.

"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store

"This company will scam you in any way possible. I had two promotions applied to my order before I placed it, and neither one applied after I paid. They charged me full price. I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store

"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

How can devs overlook a flaw so basic and fundamental. Mustn't want my money. Wonder what your bosses think of this. No way to contact either unless already paid for order. I'll go with menulog.

"Lots of extra fees, drivers can't follow instructions, people delivering food aren't the ones shown in picture which is a huge security risk. When something goes wrong you can only email and wait for a response. The Uber One savings is a hoax as they still add on extra fees. It's no longer worth it to use Uber.

So I stopped being lazy and do that most of the time now.","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ray R (Racie),Google Play Store
The reciepts do not clearly show the total amount of items within multiple combos. It only shows the items that are included in one combo.

"Uber Eats started out good, but stops giving discount codes for most-used services. For example, I only get convenience or grocery offers now, rather than the restaurant offers that I use most. I think it's time to cancel Uber One and go with just the Dash Pass. Shame, too. We used it a lot. It says a lot about a company when they stop rewarding their regular customers with offers they'll actually use. Door Dash doesn't do that, so I think I'll go with them.","November 27, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Michelle Jones,Google Play Store
"You pay so much money just to order food, and that's not considering tip. Why is the delivery fee $10, I'm paying an additional $10, and it's not tip? I've just had it. It makes more sense to order directly from a restaurant and pay cash and tip, without the ridiculous additional fees. It's so expensive and it's just not worth it.

Worse delivery app and service ever coming from someone who has used it for years. Despite having multiple issues the only help you'll ever receive is from automated responses that didn't even read your message or address it before closing it.

It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived?

"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet.

"Was loving the app so I got Uber One and since then it's been nothing but problems, I keep getting promos sent to me via email but when I try to claim them in app they won't work and the support tells you to just place the order and reach back out after for a refund but if you do it that way it takes almost a hour with support and it's liking pulling teeth to get the refund for the promo amount and then they often just give you credit instead. I use this app to save time not waste my time.","December 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jesse McBride,Google Play Store
"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store
"Stopped using it as a bug in the app placed a double order. The error didn't show up at the checkout and only became apparent as soon as I received my food. I immediately contacted customer support upon receiving my order to explain. After days of waiting they denied me a refund without explanation or rationale. Despite my previous order history of ordering the exact same items from the same place, they were not interested in investigating the app error. I've lost my trust in Uber Eats","November 11, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Smith,Google Play Store
"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

Finally got delivered cold and unsafe to eat at 8.55 because the restaurant had already made it. This was with a 10% tip and priority. I would cancel the tip but the driver that ended up delivering it doesn't deserve that. I've also been delivered the wrong thing on three occasions. I sent proof but have never been refunded.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nate Marsh,Google Play Store

I tried to cancel the order to re buy the appropriate amount of food. And was told I can cancel it,but I won't get a refund ,and they would charge me the full amount.

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item. So it's just not fair for them to rebuke our right to refund just because we requested it in past orders.","November 13, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jadeyeyeyeyey,Google Play Store

All they were able to say is 'sorry, no refund' !

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

I had a 50% off promo off $50 grocery order. I placed a Target order and was given the total with the discount. After I received the order they charged me full price.

Worst app ever. Don't waste your time or money. This place offers several good promotions but when you try and use them they don't work. I've had this happen 3 times and when you speak to any csr they are rude and have to transfer you about 3 times only to tell you someone will reach out in 3-6 business days.

I got there trial membership. I was told I had until the 2nd. But they charged me on the 1st. Of course in the fine print it says I can't cancel within 48 hours of the renewal. Says I have to contact them for help. I can't find anywhere to talk to anyone on the app. Also it says nothing is refundable. So I was already charged ahead of the renewal date and stuck with it. After the month is up. I won't be using thier app anymore because of how shady thier business practice is.,"January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Misti Phillips,Google Play Store

Deleting the app and moving on.cant even deliver from a cafe 7 minutes away. Ordered more than an hour ago. Before that i had to go to the restaurant. Before that. Had to do a second order.

I have never had to be refunded by a company so many times. Everytime other time I order food on uber eats the order gets canceled after the food has been picked up and it's so frustrating spending 50 dollars just to have to be refunded.

"The constant reminder to tip drivers when a) I've chosen not to tip them purposefully for various reasons. b) I ordered using priority delivery, thereby paying for delivery. It's patronising to have to he reminded 100 times. There are MANY negative things about Uber Eats and very FEW positives. Uber One is a savings but only by a smidge. There are no exclusive deals. In fact, many others get better deals in the same area and location. Customer retention needs a serious revisit!","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,D G,Google Play Store
"Prices are deceptive. They will raise the price of an item at a restaurant, and then give you a ""discount."" So the delivery fee is always high but hidden. Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself.

Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed.

"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order.

"would like to use this more but it's too expensive right now for me with extra fees on top of the service fee that doesn't show up until after you accept the order and the whole tipping thing here is quite pushy but there are some amazing restaurants, eateries on uber eats.","January 18, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Rachel Totman,Google Play Store
"App works alright. Had too many deliveries where I've either not received my full order, or received someone else's order. Need to do more to draw in more drivers - my area has a handful. Most don't work mornings making a breakfast delivery nigh impossible, and evening orders will normally bounce between a couple of them before being set, resulting in lukewarm food. Know who doesn't have that issue? Domino's, because they have dedicated drivers.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Calum B,Google Play Store

"Every time I'm order, it's good. The system doesn't break down or anything but it'stoo much money. The tax goes way too high and the fee for just the food is insane.

"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store

But now I've reported incorrect orders 3 times, and now I can no longer get the item fixed or refunded. I get people misused and abuse the system.

I use this app way too often, even so, I rarely bother to contact CS when my orders are wrong or missing items because the issue is never addressed or honestly resolved. I've only ever been offered a partial refund/credit even when my entire order was wrong, no full refund or offer to have the order resent and exchanged.

"Usefull app indeed but recently they're ripping more than they should. It's not enough they already added 10-15% more to the price of a product, they'll ask for ANOTHER 10% for ""service"" fee. That's 20-25% additional fee! This is different from the delivery fee which is fixed and fine but I hope this goes 100% straight to the delivery person or they're getting way out of hand on their greediness.

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account.

"Discounts mean basically nothing. 20% discounts up to $20 means you have to spend more than $50 to get the full $20 off. Feels slimy. Not to mention the poor customer service at times.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible.

I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt.

That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store

It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3.

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

But two weeks ago I ordered groceries worth almost 70 euro and only got not even half of it. So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get? They just told me that they will not be able to refund me. The same happened to friends, bolt market or Glovo are more recommendable.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nadine,Google Play Store
"Garbage app, food prices go up every week. Won't honor their own deals they push to you either. So many double deliveries that food is cold more often than not, even with paying for the membership. They also like to charge you twice when you decide to be nice and increase your tip, than try to hold the extra money for more than a week. So don't change your tip after ordering, unless you want to lose access to your money for more than a week. If I could rate zero stars, I would.","January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jamie,Google Play Store
Hate the app itself ive had too many problems with it for me to continue using it. From order errors to not being able to not being able to fully customize an order in a menu on the app. This thing is an absolute disaster and youre better off just going to the place yourself or if you cant use a different app unless it magically works for the place you want.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want. It always reloads the Uber Eats starting page and you have to manually navigate back to where the notification was supposed to take you. Especially annoying when attempting to rate an order.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

"I started with them from the beginning. There have a lot of ups and downs with deliveries and the cost has risen. I still find it very convenient in NY based in parking, gas etc. So I do utilize the service often. Especially, when they offer 40% OFF Groceries/Pets.

"Was given a $58 dollar quote at time of order than uber jacked the price up to $98 at delivery, without letting me know. Apaarently they offered a promotion at discount, removed the promo, then asked for me to prove I had a discount after I noticed the price change (customer support couldn't even provide a receipt).

Terrible service and app I will no longer be using after many years, I've seen a decline in the service and support recently, awful. Will be uninstalling.

I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilá: 2.8 stars.

Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving. Today's issue is orders not completing because the app doesn't register that you've clicked ""everything looks good"" and perpetually loads. Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection. Would also like to have the grocery option in my area... Overall, it is a great app!","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,N K,Google Play Store

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip.

I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money.

"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon.

"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12.

"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store

The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini.

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

I had a craving today, but I regret using the app because I paid a good chunk extra to have half my order arrive.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Epifocol,Google Play Store
"for the most part this a great app, easy to use great selection of food choices to chose from and so on. However when it comes down to the total pricing of everything it's pretty wild. they over price everything and give minimal return to the driver while keeping a big portion of the price to themselves. they won't let you tip more than about half the total price which is complete BS. All in all it's just another money hungry greed mongering company 🤷‍♂️","December 22, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Cayden Knight,Google Play Store
"Ease of use is OK but you can't see what restaurants you've favourited very easily, you can't find them again very easily, and when orders go wrong it's not easy to resolve. Also, many uber eats drivers phones don't actually work so you can't call them when they don't drop the order at the right place which is really painful when you've waited over an hour for the food sometimes.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,M Anonymous,Google Play Store
"It's more for there service than their app but then they don't have a way you can reach out and call someone to address your issue. I had a coupon for Uber eats which the app said is invalid whereas it was never used before, I had just purchased it. I tried reaching out to there service reps through their chat and none of them gave me the help I needed. Finally the last one said someone would reach out to me through mail since they cannot resolve it online but nobody reached out. Bad service.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anshul Madan,Google Play Store
"Terrible AI customer service in general, yet great service from the delivery drivers so far. The restaurants and stores don't have to replace missing items or inform you. They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives. I was charged £67 for 2 bottles of tonic. No logic in that whatsoever. Call your bank and report them.

"This app used to be really good. Now I find it deceptive and sneaky just like other delivery apps. Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't. It is really that simple. just paid $44 for cold, soggy food. Not 1st time","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brenden,Google Play Store
"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store
"This app is fraudulent. I've been an Uber One member for almost a decade and items are missing every other order.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

For being a one member there needs to be a help section that isn't a bot. Plus the deal's only save a few dollars and hardly ever changes from store to store. My card keeps coming up as low balance even though i have $169 and i can't ask for help because it's not on the help list at all. The problem is theres no help for anything else then what's on the help list already and there's only 4 options and only 1 leads to actually getting help from someone. That's a useless help system if you ask me,"November 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mikel Something (Phantom Man),Google Play Store

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store

Offers items not avlbl, adds $2-3 to the store price for a replacement (price seen in the photo sent to appr. Switch), and doesn't honor its own in app specials (get $x off if you buy two, etc.). The mark up plus the fees, plus asking to pay tips higher than full service waiters = rip off. Taxes+fees are 30% of total (plus delv fee) ... what are these fees?

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability. It's also easier to track your order and navigate.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra £3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the £5 compensation for late delivery. It goes on.","November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mark Horrocks,Google Play Store
Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

Highly DO NOT recommend","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,heather berboth,Google Play Store
They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless.

Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price.

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

I called the restaurant, and they confirmed my food was picked up. I called ubereats, and they said the driver claimed to have a route issue. Ubereats refunded me the money, but the experience of waiting for your food to arrive to only have it canceled sucked!

"Horrible! Incredibly disappointing customer service. Always delivering late. Even with priority delivery payed. You would think a big company would do better.

"Tipping system is down right broken, you cant tip properly until AFTER you get your order, and even so the process of editing your tip amount is both buggy and incredibly messy navigation wise. Cancellation of items is possibly the most decieving and poorly designed system. At least on the computer, cancellation is done through a CHAT BOT.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilá: 2.8 stars. So, I feel like I cannot trust ubereats ratings and this is supposed to be one of the most important features of this app. Couldn't rate differently: 1 star.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nossa Vida Pelo Mundo,Google Play Store
"After taking a long break, I came back and had great service (and used it a LOT) until the past month. Now twice in two weeks I had a driver cancel my order on their own accord. Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do. After being told I would get a $20 credit, they would give no more than $10, but when I checked and found only $.75. Liars!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Geoff Kratville,Google Play Store
This is my go to app for food ordering. There are occasionally issues with an order and they've done a great job of working it out when that happens.

"Good app with some nice deals on occasion, but needs to work on some of the menu choices. For example, multiple selections can be listed as ""required"", and not let you select multiple options when you should be able to. It's very frustrating for orders of donuts, burgers, and pizzas, and can lead to orders being wrong. This still needs to be fixed.","November 4, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Zander Locke (AlexanderLocke),Google Play Store
In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

"Support is terrible. Often they will advise there is nothing they can do, or to wait further for extremely late orders but thank you for your understanding, and will end the chat abruptly. Doesn't seem to matter if the store is late, or the delivery was bad. May as well go back to ordering direct from stores rather than using this platform. Also, promotions are far fewer, notably since getting Uber One.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ridwan Ahmed,Google Play Store

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

"Been using them loyally for 2-3 years. Only recently subbed on UberOne. I notice that the promos are much less since. My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost. Insulting.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Katie B,Google Play Store

You can't leave a nice comment to great delivery drivers to let them know they were great and should continue on that path. 2.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so... Like I said, Pros and Cons. Uber customer support is usually okay, even though my orders are regularly messed up.","January 6, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Freddy Mayo,Google Play Store
"THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY! For the last 2 months, their deliveries have been MISSING some or most of the food we paid for. The first few times, they refunded the missing items. Not anymore. Ordered food for the whole family and got ONE thing. They won't refund because there's apparently a ""limit"" for missing claims. It's simple: you pay for something, you get it. You're STEALING from me! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Asian support will just tell you to go away, and won't help at all.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joseph Boyer,Google Play Store
"I use this app daily. One gets bombarded with notifications after ordering and prompted twice for driver tips. Also, drivers must read the orders, too often they phone or text simply to ask my address , while it's all there on my profile .Participating outlets in PE very often closed or certain products simply not available.

They have a terrible system where they just keep moving back the estimated delivery and the latest delivery, then when you try to reach support about your food being late they just say sorry. Meanwhile I'm trying to be nice and not get a refund so the restaurant doesn't take a hit for Ubers lack of service.

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time.

I could be in the wrong spot, looking for something specific, but a search function that searches a specific dish and the restaurant would be great.

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

"Worst food delivery app. The drivers are 5 star, the service from uber is 1. They say you can add a tip, but don't provide an option the tell you to use non existant buttons to add a tip. I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip. In app support is useless and calling them the poor agent is only give the in app text to read to me about editing the value of the tip on the non existant tip section.","January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anthony Tecchio,Google Play Store
"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money. You are forced into a situation where you don't have food and you lose your money.","November 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kristina Mckeehan,Google Play Store
"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon. That literally doesn't make sense because the customer would have to be expecting that you wouldn't honor the coupon.","December 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alivia,Google Play Store
"Usually, this app is okay but I'm getting increasingly annoyed with how many times an order has something missing or wrong. Also, they should make restaurants include food allergy warning for certain foods. I just ordered something that never specified that there was seafood in it and I had to spit it out. I just wasted my money on something that could've made me violently ill. I hardly like to complain but this is ridiculous. This app is overly pricey and most of the time not even worth it.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alondra Vidal,Google Play Store
Terrible customer service and incorrect description for groceries. I ordered clementines. The description showed 5 lbs but you had to enter the count. The grocery shopper got one based on the count. I was incorrectly charged and the agent lied saying i would receive an updated receipt within 24 hours which never occurred. When I contacted them again they said they cant issue a refund.

Made an order and paid the rider cash through Mpesa following the rider's instructions. Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem. However a second problem comes in with trying to clear up the error. It's been a week and still the issue has not been resolved.

On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour.

"Supervisor Jude instructed me to reinstall the app in order to fix a restaurant's improperly entered menu. Problem exists on your end, not mine, duh. So, if I want to order food that's listed and get the appropriate price, I can't use this app on my phone, tablet or website since the menu itself is incorrect. This has gone unresolved for about 2 months. Also, tell your support team it's impossible to send screenshots in the app. So, quit instructing people to send them or add the functionality.","November 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lucas Downton,Google Play Store

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store

Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly.

I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order.

I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee?

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

"I have roughly 20-30 places near me that I can order from and Uber One does not cut any delivery fees from a single one of them... It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived? Service fee hikes in price when you get deals/promos.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,rin kagamine,Google Play Store

"There are many unreliable drivers and no way to properly get help with the order other than cancelling. I've had meals that are picked up and then the driver cancels after I've waited over an hour. I've paid for priority delivery only to watch the driver drive to a completely different area of the city, extending the delivery time before making the delivery.

"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food. While the delivery service by itself is convenient, I feel I should never be paying $40 for a meal that is only $12.99.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Love Of Nikki (ForTheLoveOfNikki),Google Play Store

They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet.

The app is ok. It often crashes or there are errors with summing up totals with promotions. There are also a lot of issues with your Uber wallet being used for payments.

I have had previous issue with missing items in orders, and have never had an issue with getting refunds for those items. The amount of issues compared to the amount in order is not a lot.

My card keeps coming up as low balance even though i have $169 and i can't ask for help because it's not on the help list at all.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie Negrõn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order. I have asked for more refunds and cancelled orders in the last month than i have in the entire year. Thoroughly upset,"December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan G,Google Play Store

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra £3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the £5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

That's 20-25% additional fee! This is different from the delivery fee which is fixed and fine but I hope this goes 100% straight to the delivery person or they're getting way out of hand on their greediness. What a rip-off.","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,RenceDRenz,Google Play Store
"The app has some annoying bugs but its fine, the problem is with the customer service, if anything goes wrong with your order then you are helpless.

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account. You can not contact Uber to tell them that you have lost your credit card and need to give them the updated details because you need your old details to even be able to contact them.

The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

Absolutely worst experience. Especially after you take time to finally decide what you want ro order and this happens.

"PLEASE DONT USE THIS APP. This app is absolutely terrible. The customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. after receiving the wrong order, I was denied a refund by customer service, and when I wrote a reply, instead of getting back to me they closed my comment and said the issue was resolved. I've written back three times, and each time they close the conversation and mark it as resolved.

"Bottom barrel support, outsourced call center has no idea what's going on any time I try to get help, can't connect you to a supervisor and won't follow up with actual issues, regularly have issues getting worse and worse and will need to cancel Uber Pass and go to Door Dash if it continues.

"Everything is more expensive just base cost alone before any other fees. McChicken from McDonald's at this moment is $7. That's a $2 sandwich!

Seems like every positive is greedily neutralized by negatives.","December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bocaj470,Google Play Store
"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store

"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service.

"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue.

Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

No explanation, no record of order in app. Meanwhile payment has been taken out. Can you talk to someone about this? NO!!!! EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION WITH SUPPORT IS FORCED TO BE ABOUT AN ORDER.

I use Uber one to help with those fees and, in some cases, still can be $4 for ""taxes and fees"" on a $20 order.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store

I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse.

I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied.

Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop.

"There are many unreliable drivers and no way to properly get help with the order other than cancelling. I've had meals that are picked up and then the driver cancels after I've waited over an hour. I've paid for priority delivery only to watch the driver drive to a completely different area of the city, extending the delivery time before making the delivery. The automated customer service helps with is if something's missing from the order and then you only get a credit, not a refund.","December 3, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Gallup,Google Play Store
"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food. While the delivery service by itself is convenient, I feel I should never be paying $40 for a meal that is only $12.99.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Love Of Nikki (ForTheLoveOfNikki),Google Play Store

"The app itself works great, but the service has dropped off a huge amount since I started using this. All of the hidden fees are ridiculous leading to outrageous prices. When the service sucks so bad, this is unacceptable. Lately, almost every time, I'm either missing items from my order, or my delivery is ""taking longer than expected"". Upsetting.

I stopped using this app awhile back because not only is it expensive, when something goes missing, you don't get compensation for the cost of the delivery fee, just the missing item.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet.

I have had previous issue with missing items in orders, and have never had an issue with getting refunds for those items. The amount of issues compared to the amount in order is not a lot. Recently I have had two separate orders from two separate restaurants that had missing items. I was denied refunds, even with proof the 2nd time and confirmed with driver was missing before accepting.","December 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Sonja Friesen,Google Play Store

My card keeps coming up as low balance even though i have $169 and i can't ask for help because it's not on the help list at all.

Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie Negrõn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order. I have asked for more refunds and cancelled orders in the last month than i have in the entire year. Thoroughly upset,"December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan G,Google Play Store
"The most useless delivery service app and the worst customer experience I've ever had.

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra £3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the £5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account. You can not contact Uber to tell them that you have lost your credit card and need to give them the updated details because you need your old details to even be able to contact them.

The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

Tired of seeing drivers accept orders, not pick it up, and it say ""Oops finding another delivery person"" over and over. 4 times on a single order last week!","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Peter Souza,Google Play Store
"Everything is more expensive just base cost alone before any other fees. McChicken from McDonald's at this moment is $7. That's a $2 sandwich! Keep getting notifications to use the app when there are no coupons, no incentive. Using uber one free trial has been a waste of high hopes. Seems like every positive is greedily neutralized by negatives.","December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bocaj470,Google Play Store
"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats. Constantly transfer you, make you start the conversation from scratch, and then close it out before the issue is resolved or you can respond.

Highly DO NOT recommend","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,heather berboth,Google Play Store
They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless.

"Got a very poor food service from a uber eats restaurant, it was supposed to be a submelt but the paper came stuck on the bread, ordered as well some cheese bites which was from days ago or you could see the dryness. Requested a refund, and got previous refunds for much less hassle, and didn't get it! Very poor customer service overall from that experience.

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Their support is a joke. I had an issue with the app sending in an incorrect order and the customer service rep told me if I accept delivery of the order I can reference the conversation and get a refund. I followed those steps and Uber has refused my refund and I am unable to open a support ticket with a person to resolve this. There was one opened however the rep closed it out without my permission or everything being made right.

I'm editing my previous 1 star review by saying I wish I could make it Negative 1 Star for the fact that they also charge you more than the store for the food on top of charging you heavily for delivery and service fees.

That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

It user to be Easy to use. Very useful. But now if you have issue such as items missing or the restaurant not following orders which means the food goes to waste along with the money.

"Had previously left a review. Got rid of that to re-rate it with a lower score because of changes to the refund policy in recent months. Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault. I'll be moving to a delivery service that actually pretends to care.","November 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eli Blevins,Google Play Store
"One of the worst food delivery apps. My first order after Uber One got delayed by 25 mins from the latest delivery time. Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"". Finally asked them to cancel my Uber One subscription, they closed the chat saying we cannot do anything.

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The fees are high enough as it is.,"December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Martin Patey,Google Play Store

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me.

Note that I had the UberOne membership and it didn't help get the issue to be resolved any faster.","November 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Under GaminG,Google Play Store
"Horrible app UX when it comes to placing the second order after the first! They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for. Last but not least, they use the driver timeout loophole to justify not refunding the issue due to an horrible app UX.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,chris,Google Play Store
"Communication between the app (Uber) and the restaurants is not consistently accurate, customization is no longer available in many cases, Uber is very hesitant to refund when errors occur and often refers back to the restaurant who will send you back to Uber, and on and on with no good solution. I love it when it's good and that's why I'm giving it 2⭐️'s, but lately I have issues with almost every order and then I am chastised by Uber for reporting errors as though I am looking for freebies.","November 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Christine Keen,Google Play Store
"I recently received terrible customer service from Uber Eats after one of my orders was to my knowledge stolen by one of their drivers. After some time the agents stopped responding and I was no longer able to contact them by phone. Honestly, I've been with this company for a long time and now it seems that they leave everything up to automation and use template responses for complicated situations.

My experience is ALWAYS TRASH!!!! My FOOD nevee arrives within the time stated! I have had one to many credits for the same damn reason. It's not even worth the deals provided because by the timw the food get's here an hour past the original ETA. I am beyond frustrated. Doordash is by far easier and much more reliable.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it. That is more because of the restaurants that get busy from Uber and other ordering services than on Uber itself.","January 14, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Great Gabe,Google Play Store
"The UI is good - however, the app keeps directing orders nearly a block away from my work's warehouse park.

I also wish replacements for wrong orders were an option and not just refunds.","November 23, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Tetyana M,Google Play Store
Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want. It always reloads the Uber Eats starting page and you have to manually navigate back to where the notification was supposed to take you. Especially annoying when attempting to rate an order.

Also can't unsubscribe to Uber One because it hid the option.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Todd Turner,Google Play Store

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan. It just seems like a massive amount of data and computing power going to waste. It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store
I ordered food from a restaurant and i had an issue with the payment. But the order was still processed without me paying. I looked for ways to pay but couldn't find it. The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues.

For example they will give me 30% 40% 50% off, all of them are the same ""up to £12 off"" and they don't work for most restaurants. The service/delivery fee is also very high compared to other apps. I don't see why order from here when you could use Deliveroo instead which is cheaper, has a better service and better restaurants.

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

Worst delivery service. I paid for a priority delivery and my order came 2 hours later. And they refused to refund me as the order was placed over 48 hours ago.

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing?

A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store
"My order request never arrived at the restaurant. The uber app functioned as nornal, and driver quit everytime they arrived at the drive through window. Ny 5th driver decided to inform me they never received my order request. I cancelled and was charged for an order that would never have arrived. Multiple drivers were wasting their time going there. The app also didn't inform me of a fee when i chose to cancel at that moment. Uber support completely ignored and disregarded the main issue.","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dale B,Google Play Store

Refund doesn't cut it, that's just frustrating to keep 2aiting and end up startving becuase everything else is just closed because we trusted Uber Eats to deliver us food and didn't plan for a back up.

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time.

They will steal your money! Refused to refund items not received. Said I had too many problems with orders. IT'S NOT MY FAULT that about 1 in 4 orders are missing items or have incorrect items. Don't dare complain about issues with your order or you'll be punished. If they took the time to look at my account they would see that I spend a lot of money ordering from Uber Eats.

This app is overly pricey and most of the time not even worth it.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alondra Vidal,Google Play Store
Terrible customer service and incorrect description for groceries. I ordered clementines. The description showed 5 lbs but you had to enter the count. The grocery shopper got one based on the count. I was incorrectly charged and the agent lied saying i would receive an updated receipt within 24 hours which never occurred. When I contacted them again they said they cant issue a refund. I disputed with Paypal and won. Now the app wont let me place an order until I pay the amount back.,"November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Amy Gomanie,Google Play Store
Made an order and paid the rider cash through Mpesa following the rider's instructions. Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem. However a second problem comes in with trying to clear up the error. It's been a week and still the issue has not been resolved. This is so frustrating expecially as I use the app (both transport and delivery) quite a lot 🤬,"January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Praxedes Abutto,Google Play Store

On the positive now can acquire a large assortment of items (i.e. take out, food shopping, spirites, convenience items, etc.) The fee structure feels little high although offers value.

Horrible app for food! I cancelled an order immediately after submitting bc it automatically charged the wrong card (it doesn't even give you an option to select payment method).

The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour.

Horrible customer service. Spent over 3 hours waiting for food to be delivered from a restaurant 2 miles away.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day. Biggest issue is with drivers but that's not really ubers fault. This is so much better than calling a restaurant only for them to not write it down correct or for me to forget to order something.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house. Also the fees are over priced making it hard to tip the drivers that deserve it (the ones that don't steal).,"December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angel Boling,Google Play Store
"$11 service fee?? The order is already $31 (originally $53 before discounts), and they expect me to pay an extra $11? Apparently for ""basket size and cost related to the uber.""

Better experience than with similar services. Love that they require a PIN so they know food gets to you or that they aren't dropping hot food on my cold porch and running off which is a big problem for other services.

"Only issue is the items on Uber eats are more expensive when you use Uber eats then when you go to the store to buy items. Also in some restaurants, you will order a meal. Then find out that it doesn't even come with a drink. The drinks are like 5 bucks, but they want to call it a meal. That is false advertising 💯.

One of the worst customer service support you can get. You get put on hold and be told to hold on the link for 2 min which then turns into 20 min and the rep does not decide to join back on the call or you keep getting bounced 8 times.

This cheap ahh company won't even automatically refund you for wrong items. They make you go through the trouble of contacting them themselves.

Uber does not(or if they do they do a terrible job) quality check the restaurants they sign on to their service. They do not allow you to speak to someone to make complaints.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store

It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3.

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

From order errors to not being able to not being able to fully customize an order in a menu on the app. This thing is an absolute disaster and youre better off just going to the place yourself or if you cant use a different app unless it magically works for the place you want.

I called the restaurant, and they confirmed my food was picked up. I called ubereats, and they said the driver claimed to have a route issue. Ubereats refunded me the money, but the experience of waiting for your food to arrive to only have it canceled sucked!

"Horrible! Incredibly disappointing customer service. Always delivering late. Even with priority delivery payed. You would think a big company would do better.

"Tipping system is down right broken, you cant tip properly until AFTER you get your order, and even so the process of editing your tip amount is both buggy and incredibly messy navigation wise. Cancellation of items is possibly the most decieving and poorly designed system. At least on the computer, cancellation is done through a CHAT BOT.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"Communication between the app (Uber) and the restaurants is not consistently accurate, customization is no longer available in many cases, Uber is very hesitant to refund when errors occur and often refers back to the restaurant who will send you back to Uber, and on and on with no good solution.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

I also wish replacements for wrong orders were an option and not just refunds.","November 23, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Tetyana M,Google Play Store
Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want. It always reloads the Uber Eats starting page and you have to manually navigate back to where the notification was supposed to take you. Especially annoying when attempting to rate an order.

Also can't unsubscribe to Uber One because it hid the option.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Todd Turner,Google Play Store

Very much a bait and switch technique to get you to engage with the app, apply the promotion and then have it rejected right at the end as you are about to pay hoping that you'll pay full proce having gone through the account set up.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store

The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues.

They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

Terrible service and app I will no longer be using after many years, I've seen a decline in the service and support recently, awful. Will be uninstalling. I'll probably have to get a charge back from my credit card company. Also got charged for an order that got cancelled.

I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilá: 2.8 stars.

Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do.

"Good app with some nice deals on occasion, but needs to work on some of the menu choices. For example, multiple selections can be listed as ""required"", and not let you select multiple options when you should be able to.

This still needs to be fixed.","November 4, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Zander Locke (AlexanderLocke),Google Play Store
In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection.

"The app is slow and prone to freezing if browsing for any extended period of time. As for the service itself, I got charged a $15 restocking fee for a failed order because my delivery driver didn't know how to read a driver's license.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so... Like I said, Pros and Cons. Uber customer support is usually okay, even though my orders are regularly messed up.","January 6, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Freddy Mayo,Google Play Store

Ordered food for the whole family and got ONE thing. They won't refund because there's apparently a ""limit"" for missing claims. It's simple: you pay for something, you get it.

They have a terrible system where they just keep moving back the estimated delivery and the latest delivery, then when you try to reach support about your food being late they just say sorry.

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

"Worst food delivery app. The drivers are 5 star, the service from uber is 1. They say you can add a tip, but don't provide an option the tell you to use non existant buttons to add a tip. I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip.

"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money.

"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon. That literally doesn't make sense because the customer would have to be expecting that you wouldn't honor the coupon.","December 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alivia,Google Play Store
"Usually, this app is okay but I'm getting increasingly annoyed with how many times an order has something missing or wrong. Also, they should make restaurants include food allergy warning for certain foods. I just ordered something that never specified that there was seafood in it and I had to spit it out.

Made an order and paid the rider cash through Mpesa following the rider's instructions. Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

The app stated the code had been successfully applied, but when I viewed my new order total, I saw that it was unchanged.

Nothing was redeemed and applied towards any order placed.","November 6, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lena Wurden (Lawwolfrox),Google Play Store

Ubereats is a great app for food ordering. Very reliable service and intuitive app. Very good customer service that is always willing to help if there are any issues with orders. I do enjoy the option to be able to have my order delivered with priority for a small fee.

Awful. Extremely upcharged for ever item. Always shows up 30-1 hrs late past the estimated time. Drivers accept orders then don't move to collect orders. And orders are canceled after shuffling 3 or 4 drivers wasting hours when they could simply cancel it after the first driver decided to not pick up the order. Useless expensive app. Do not recommend.,"December 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jeffrey Austin,Google Play Store
"Keep having problems with almost all deliveries and Uber Eats takes no responsibility. Food items that don't arrive and I'm still charged for them even though the restaurants tell me to ask for refund. Now an order has been cancelled and no refund was issued and the order disappeared from my history. Payment details keep changing for some reason. Get a damn QA for your app, it's horrible.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nuno Ramos,Google Play Store
"While customer service is always great, im giving this 3/5 due to repreated issues with grocery fulfillment. Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk). The level of involvement and refunding to get maybe half my order makes this app not useful at all. I wish the shoppers would just not choose grocery if they aren't able to tell lettuce from onions.","January 2, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Petra Thomas,Google Play Store

They handle customers service terribly and they make you wait 2 +hours just to find out they canceled your order. And then they don't want to refund you the money because it is an inconvenience.

Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible.

The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard.

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

I alos paid almost twice the food price for a chicken sandwich because of two sets of fees, taxes and (lowest option) tip. A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me.

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

Very much a bait and switch technique to get you to engage with the app, apply the promotion and then have it rejected right at the end as you are about to pay hoping that you'll pay full proce having gone through the account set up. Pretty sneaky stuff. No wonder it's doing so badly in Sweden.","December 16, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mark Gallagher,Google Play Store
Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous. You're better off ordering delivery directly from the restaurants where you pay for delivery and tip or just driving there.,"November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Roman Ivanyushchenko,Google Play Store
"Can it really be that difficult to configure the app so that the list of restaurants isn't constantly, automatically, uncontrollably scrolling back up to the top?

"The app has a few issues, as far as GPS goes. Mainly, getting the driver to your address if you live in a more unique environment. Refunds and customer complaints are compartmentalized, and often ignored. They do not allow you to double order from any other restaurants you would want to. The inflation of menu items is very high, with tips also being pushed hard.","December 14, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shane Morey,Google Play Store

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan. It just seems like a massive amount of data and computing power going to waste. It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store
I ordered food from a restaurant and i had an issue with the payment. But the order was still processed without me paying. I looked for ways to pay but couldn't find it. The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues. But then i canceled the order as i had to go out later only to be served a processing fee of 25 cad. If my payment was the issue then you shouldn't have gone ahead with the order.

"It keeps getting worse. They lowkey try to trick people with ""discounts"". For example they will give me 30% 40% 50% off, all of them are the same ""up to £12 off"" and they don't work for most restaurants. The service/delivery fee is also very high compared to other apps. I don't see why order from here when you could use Deliveroo instead which is cheaper, has a better service and better restaurants. Ordering from Deliveroo without discount is cheaper than Uber Eats with 30% off.","November 5, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ioana Belu,Google Play Store

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up. If you refuse their subscription, they purposely overcharge, and there is no real breakdown of who gets the service charge money.","December 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia White,Google Play Store

"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store

"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

Finally got delivered cold and unsafe to eat at 8.55 because the restaurant had already made it. This was with a 10% tip and priority.

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item. So it's just not fair for them to rebuke our right to refund just because we requested it in past orders.","November 13, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jadeyeyeyeyey,Google Play Store

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

"Terrible app and support is somehow worse. I placed an order, paid and then the app simply had the order disappear. I looked into my orders and it just didn't exist as an upcoming or previous order. Tried to get support through the app, can't because no order existed to contact help about. Went to social media to at least talk to someone from the company. I provide them screenshots of a charge to my account, my recent order list where there is no order and they won't help.

You can't leave a nice comment to great delivery drivers to let them know they were great and should continue on that path. 2.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing?

"The constant reminder to tip drivers when a) I've chosen not to tip them purposefully for various reasons. b) I ordered using priority delivery, thereby paying for delivery. It's patronising to have to he reminded 100 times. There are MANY negative things about Uber Eats and very FEW positives. Uber One is a savings but only by a smidge. There are no exclusive deals.

"I used to be an avid user of Uber Eats, I even got the monthly membership because I felt it was beneficial since I used it so much. After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time. That was highly irritating, especially when it was a safety issue with half cooked food.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dana Bowman,Google Play Store
"I was double charged on a gift card and attempted to get it resolved. After about a day the respone I got was that I could only alter my tip within an hour after my order was delivered. After that I was ignored. Thanks a lot for helping yourself to some of my Christmas gift and refusing to return it when it's clearly a duplicate charge. Never had to leave a review like this before in my life. If it happened once, I'm assuming you steal quite a lot from your customers.

"Their service fees are sometimes very inconsistent for no explainable reason. The driver's are great, but it sucks when a restaurant screws up your order and there's no one to help, except for Uber chat and that can take hours and hours to get in touch with you. Also, when some restaurants pack the food they put doughnuts beside got soup and don't think there's anything wrong with that!!! They do a horrible job at packing food.

They will steal your money! Refused to refund items not received. Said I had too many problems with orders. IT'S NOT MY FAULT that about 1 in 4 orders are missing items or have incorrect items. Don't dare complain about issues with your order or you'll be punished. If they took the time to look at my account they would see that I spend a lot of money ordering from Uber Eats.

"Worst app ever, I tried a new subscription to Uber one, and i didn't like it. Now they deduct money for next month subscription even before the defined date, although i didn't want it. The worst part is there is no way to cancel the subscription, and i basically lost my money because they deducted money from my account. I will not trust this app anymore.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,KANAAN MOUSAEI,Google Play Store

"Stopped using it when my orders from a restaurant that was a block away me would take trips around the city before getting to me.

I do however think the delivery fees can be pretty high. I tend to use door dash for that reason. That's why I go with 3 stars.

"Too many fees, the service it's self works fine and I got my food in a timely matter. My issue is service fees. I can understand having a delivery fee if your driver is driving an excessive amount of miles to drop your food off. That's no big deal. Then there was a freaking service fee that was almost $10 on top of the delivery fee, %25 tip I left, and taxes. What the hell is a service fee? This should be more clear.

The prices have been inflated to a larger degree than if you were to either order from the place directly or pick it up.

Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from.

Sometimes places are closed and it doesnt tell you until after youve tried to place an order, and the pound of delivery fees is ridiculous.

"This Uber App and Customer service on here is terrible. I would rate zero stars if it allowed me. It's delayed with driver information. Then it takes awhile stating that the restaurant is preparing your order. But 30 minutes later nothing, then when I cancel they want to charge you for driver's time which was not even assigned to a driver. It seems as if the order did not go through. I pay for priority delivery and get a bicycle delivery with no food warmer bag to keep food warm. Food is cold.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nandranie Beerai,Google Play Store

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

"Garbage app, food prices go up every week. Won't honor their own deals they push to you either. So many double deliveries that food is cold more often than not, even with paying for the membership. They also like to charge you twice when you decide to be nice and increase your tip, than try to hold the extra money for more than a week. So don't change your tip after ordering, unless you want to lose access to your money for more than a week.

The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

"Was given a $58 dollar quote at time of order than uber jacked the price up to $98 at delivery, without letting me know. Apaarently they offered a promotion at discount, removed the promo, then asked for me to prove I had a discount after I noticed the price change (customer support couldn't even provide a receipt). Word to wise, take screen shots, uber can change pricing and ask you to prove it.","December 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bryan Sheppard,Google Play Store

Terrible service and app I will no longer be using after many years, I've seen a decline in the service and support recently, awful. Will be uninstalling. I'll probably have to get a charge back from my credit card company. Also got charged for an order that got cancelled.

I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilá: 2.8 stars.

Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

It then 'costs $19' to cancel the order; press their customer support chatbot and theyll give you a refund for the cancellation fee.

My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive £ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving. Today's issue is orders not completing because the app doesn't register that you've clicked ""everything looks good"" and perpetually loads. Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection. Would also like to have the grocery option in my area... Overall, it is a great app!","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,N K,Google Play Store

"The app is slow and prone to freezing if browsing for any extended period of time.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

Ordered food for the whole family and got ONE thing. They won't refund because there's apparently a ""limit"" for missing claims. It's simple: you pay for something, you get it.

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

The driver(s) wouldn't even answer my call or tried to argue my instruction that were written vs the app giving them a different address/location.","December 12, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Willi Taylor,Google Play Store
"Annoying bug at the moment, if your balance is low and the payment won't process. A window will appear that will stop the order from going through. Now if you exit uber eats, transfer your money across and hit re order, you will receive the exact same pop up and you will not be able to proceed. You will have to clear your cart and re order everything again for it to work.","December 13, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Jack Varley,Google Play Store
The most frusterating UX design possible and constantly changning the interface for the sake of it.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip.

"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money.

"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon.

Made an order and paid the rider cash through Mpesa following the rider's instructions. Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem.

"Pretty much always 40% off promos! and seemingly, you get an offer for a 3 month free trial of uber one every 4-5 months and after your trial ends and you cancel the membership they offer you a discounted month subscription for $0.99!

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee. SECOND order, 3 drivers canceled on me, so uber eats canceled my order then gave me a cancelation fee. I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Uber may have a wide range of restaurants, but their help is terrible compared to Doordash, I have to wait 3-5 business days for them to release a hold on my money, too bad I was trying to eat today.

Awful. Extremely upcharged for ever item. Always shows up 30-1 hrs late past the estimated time. Drivers accept orders then don't move to collect orders.

Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk). The level of involvement and refunding to get maybe half my order makes this app not useful at all.

"Every year when we go to Portugal for the Christmas holidays it's the same problem. It won't accept our address. There are 4 buildings side by side with different door names: 7, 7A, 7B, 7C. Each building has 26 apartments and the app refuses to accept the address ""7"", it forces the 7C automatically, making it impossible for us to order in. It's not an issue if it's for a lift, because we'd pick up the ride downstairs at the apartment building entrance. But makes it impossible to order food.","January 1, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gonçalo Cal,Google Play Store

I tried to contact to find out why my order was cancelled but there is no way. The only way there is an option called help which will give you general stupid suggesions on why your order could be cancelled.

Save your money, go get the food and save yourself 10-15 bucks. Priced it out, you'll pay 26-30% more, then pay ""service fees"" then delivery fees, then tips, which they shame you into.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart.

So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

I called the restaurant, and they confirmed my food was picked up. I called ubereats, and they said the driver claimed to have a route issue. Ubereats refunded me the money, but the experience of waiting for your food to arrive to only have it canceled sucked!

"Tipping system is down right broken, you cant tip properly until AFTER you get your order, and even so the process of editing your tip amount is both buggy and incredibly messy navigation wise. Cancellation of items is possibly the most decieving and poorly designed system. At least on the computer, cancellation is done through a CHAT BOT.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

"I have not experienced serious issues with the app, but one thing got me startled. I ordered from a 4.7 stars restaurant today (more than 200 ratings). The food was terrible and expensive. I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilá: 2.8 stars. So, I feel like I cannot trust ubereats ratings and this is supposed to be one of the most important features of this app. Couldn't rate differently: 1 star.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nossa Vida Pelo Mundo,Google Play Store
"After taking a long break, I came back and had great service (and used it a LOT) until the past month. Now twice in two weeks I had a driver cancel my order on their own accord. Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do. After being told I would get a $20 credit, they would give no more than $10, but when I checked and found only $.75. Liars!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Geoff Kratville,Google Play Store
