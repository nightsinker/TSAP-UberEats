"Edit: they brought the feature back! Used to be amazing, but they just got rid of their best feature, the ability to search for dishes. You used to be able to search for a specific dish and find everyone who makes that dish and delivers to you and how much they charge. Now it's just a mediocre delivery app... why would you get rid of this feature???","January 18, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Rufus Wright,Google Play Store
"Lately it's very common to wait over 2 hours for the food, while the order is passed on to 3 or 4 drivers before one finally cancels. What in the world is wrong with this app? If more than one driver passes on, it should auto cancel. Otherwise I'm waiting for food that I'm not sure if it will arrive, and then it never does. Literally not rendering the service. Happens constantly. HUGE problem. System needs a change.","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bastian H,Google Play Store
"Very disappointed in this app. I've used it for a long time but the service fees keep increasing, sometimes up to $20 extra for a small 10 items order. Also, as I'm adding to my cart for promotions, the promotion disappears. Lastly, the prices for items are often higher than in store. Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible. Drivers also seem to be rarely checked out by uber (different person turns up to who is registered) so security/safety issues. Some of the drivers are also pretty rubbish and constantly cancel once they accept leaving you waiting for ages for another delivery person and food then turns up cold.,"January 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,broomee c,Google Play Store
Don't like the fact u can't get a refund unless u take a picture and it takes a second for u to be able to rate so u can go back to ur receipt and say something is wrong by then my foods cold. I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt. I thinking the rating part should activate right after the order is completed and in the ratings be able to say if something was missing or not. Besides that it's great,"January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Teresa Anderson,Google Play Store
"Awful application. Use Glovo instead if you have it. No chat function with support is provided. I ordered food, received a bank withdrawal, saw that the order had been created, and then confirmed. Ten minutes later, it's just disappeared, and while getting help within limited application options, I came across a mandatory order to choose in order to proceed to report my issue. Of course, I couldn't do that because my order just disappeared, and there were no hinting notifications.","January 19, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is Tomas,Google Play Store
"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification. I order the same things but they never look the same or miss items more and more, the quality of food is definitely decreasing while the prices keep rising.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sahra O,Google Play Store
"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants. After years of being a loyal customer, it still doesn't get what I like and don't! Too expensive for absolutely no reason.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ishak Al Khatib,Google Play Store
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store
"I placed a takeaway order on UberEats and the status page showed that I can add items from grocery stores for no delivery fee. I decided to give that a go and added some items from Co-Op. When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost Â£7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store
"Horrible I had an uber 1, trial & when it came time to cancel. I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to. And that was days after the trial period was over and was expected to pay for the subscription, I never used the benefits of the subscription 1 single time.","January 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,james Linge,Google Play Store
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store
"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store
"Overpriced and misleading app. Got an email that said "" get 60% off your order as a welcome back"" so I decided to order for once. Clicked the email link, it opened the app, took me to the restaraunts that accepted this offer. I get to checkout and the discount does not apply. Spent 20 minutes trying to find a way to apply the discount, but there was no where in the options for it. Following that, the order was incorrect and cold. Unacceptable. Uber died and its corpse delivers disappointment","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Zane Elliott,Google Play Store
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store
"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store
"Update: bug has been fixed. On another note, to uber eats drivers. Stop leaving the food in front of doors. The majority of front doors open outwards. Meaning that food gets ruined or can't be access easily because it is blocking the door's ability to open. ~ App seems to have a bug. When I click on an item the screen goes blank and I can't order any food.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Google user,Google Play Store
"This company will scam you in any way possible. I had two promotions applied to my order before I placed it, and neither one applied after I paid. They charged me full price. I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store
"Mysterious disappearing promotions. Looks like a promotion, you click on it and it disappears, or your order gets rejected and the promotion disappears. Customer services are obsessed with screenshots of disappeared promotions because they clearly don't understand the concept of disappeared... Used to function and offer good promotions, now not worth it.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,N H,Google Play Store
"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12. It's basically for ""emergencies"" when you're in a city overnight for a layover, but that's about it. But otherwise, love it!","November 17, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lisa Coester,Google Play Store
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini. What a scam!","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,anthonio j,Google Play Store
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available ð. I got charged over Â£6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available.

Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes.

"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange!

"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store
"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store
"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3. Certain restaurants get un-favorited every day for some reason. Even after adding back they don't appear in my faves.","November 9, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jeremy B,Google Play Store
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

When I select an item, I'm not able to customize it, select add-ons, or read more about the item. It just takes me to a blank screen where I can only add to cart. Based on recent reviews in the Play Store, it seems others are having a similar issue.

Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour.

Simply put, if I pay for a service, and that service is incorrectly provided in the form of missing, incorrect, or old and cold items, I want a refund. I don't want some mealy-mouthed runaround about how it's the restaurant's fault.

Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"".

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

"What started so good has been ruined. Every single time I order something (maybe 5-10 minutes away) the carrier gets sent to pick/deliver another order which means my food gets cold and spends double the time on route to me. This is clearly a setting on the app but sucks and usually sends the carrier far away from my location, is not something on the same route but a total detour. Now my food is always cold or not appetizing.","November 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Richie Crotin,Google Play Store

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

For example they will give me 30% 40% 50% off, all of them are the same ""up to Â£12 off"" and they don't work for most restaurants. The service/delivery fee is also very high compared to other apps. I don't see why order from here when you could use Deliveroo instead which is cheaper, has a better service and better restaurants. Ordering from Deliveroo without discount is cheaper than Uber Eats with 30% off.","November 5, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ioana Belu,Google Play Store

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up. If you refuse their subscription, they purposely overcharge, and there is no real breakdown of who gets the service charge money.","December 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia White,Google Play Store

"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store

"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order.

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item.

The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

"Got an email today saying they're getting rid of the $5 credit for when your delivery arrives past the ""latest arrival time"" for Uber One. That time is far past the ""expected delivery time"" so customers should be given something for the inconvenience. Now are drivers going to be allowed to be really late and we get nothing? Also, they mainly give discounts or promo things for rides and I mainly use this for ordering food. I might check out other food apps and see if there's something better.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,pinky1234567,Google Play Store
"Terrible they cancelled my order and charged me for it. It is impossible to resolve this issue through the app and customer service is virtually non existent. The do not respond to Facebook. X, or the website. When you call customer service the only option is for rider's and current orders. When I choose rider option to talk to a person they are rude and send you in a loop back to the app. I can prove they cancelled and I payed but they completely ignore me.

Worst app ever. Don't waste your time or money. This place offers several good promotions but when you try and use them they don't work. I've had this happen 3 times and when you speak to any csr they are rude and have to transfer you about 3 times only to tell you someone will reach out in 3-6 business days.

I got there trial membership. I was told I had until the 2nd. But they charged me on the 1st. Of course in the fine print it says I can't cancel within 48 hours of the renewal. Says I have to contact them for help. I can't find anywhere to talk to anyone on the app. Also it says nothing is refundable. So I was already charged ahead of the renewal date and stuck with it.

I have never had to be refunded by a company so many times. Everytime other time I order food on uber eats the order gets canceled after the food has been picked up and it's so frustrating spending 50 dollars just to have to be refunded.

"The constant reminder to tip drivers when a) I've chosen not to tip them purposefully for various reasons. b) I ordered using priority delivery, thereby paying for delivery. It's patronising to have to he reminded 100 times. There are MANY negative things about Uber Eats and very FEW positives. Uber One is a savings but only by a smidge. There are no exclusive deals. In fact, many others get better deals in the same area and location. Customer retention needs a serious revisit!","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,D G,Google Play Store
"Prices are deceptive. They will raise the price of an item at a restaurant, and then give you a ""discount."" So the delivery fee is always high but hidden. Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed.

"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

"Awful application. Use Glovo instead if you have it. No chat function with support is provided. I ordered food, received a bank withdrawal, saw that the order had been created, and then confirmed. Ten minutes later, it's just disappeared, and while getting help within limited application options, I came across a mandatory order to choose in order to proceed to report my issue. Of course, I couldn't do that because my order just disappeared, and there were no hinting notifications.","January 19, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is Tomas,Google Play Store
"I used the app occasionally but I had to delete it right after every use, I was being overwhelmed with unwanted fake promo codes that can't be applied because of it's location and constant notification.

"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible.

We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"".

When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost Â£7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to!

"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold).

At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later.

I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order.

"This company will scam you in any way possible. I had two promotions applied to my order before I placed it, and neither one applied after I paid. They charged me full price. I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store

"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food.

"Was loving the app so I got Uber One and since then it's been nothing but problems, I keep getting promos sent to me via email but when I try to claim them in app they won't work and the support tells you to just place the order and reach back out after for a refund but if you do it that way it takes almost a hour with support and it's liking pulling teeth to get the refund for the promo amount and then they often just give you credit instead. I use this app to save time not waste my time.","December 5, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jesse McBride,Google Play Store
"I never used this app before and created an account after they gave me a ""first order voucher"". Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had. When I contacted them right after my order, they responded 24 HOURS LATER, saying my account was suspicious or something according to their terms, basically an excuse to not pay the promo. I deleted my account.","December 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ia Asd,Google Play Store
"Stopped using it as a bug in the app placed a double order. The error didn't show up at the checkout and only became apparent as soon as I received my food. I immediately contacted customer support upon receiving my order to explain. After days of waiting they denied me a refund without explanation or rationale. Despite my previous order history of ordering the exact same items from the same place, they were not interested in investigating the app error.

"Downloaded this app again to give it a try again and about 45 mins after placing my order it was cancelled with a vague explanation and no way to submit a complaint, just an endless loop of buttons that brings you back to the same thing. By then most restaurants closed and since I hadn't received a notification about the fact that my order was going to be cancelled I couldn't place another order. Maybe you should spend more on the app than on promotions.","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tasneem Khandaker,Google Play Store

Finally got delivered cold and unsafe to eat at 8.55 because the restaurant had already made it. This was with a 10% tip and priority. I would cancel the tip but the driver that ended up delivering it doesn't deserve that. I've also been delivered the wrong thing on three occasions. I sent proof but have never been refunded.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nate Marsh,Google Play Store

"I'm lazy and I use this app a lot. It's pretty good. However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items. Those refund requests are legit and justified because I almost always have a missing item. So it's just not fair for them to rebuke our right to refund just because we requested it in past orders.","November 13, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Jadeyeyeyeyey,Google Play Store

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

I had a 50% off promo off $50 grocery order. I placed a Target order and was given the total with the discount. After I received the order they charged me full price. The promo completely disappeared. I contacted support but they said without screenshot of the promo they would not be able to help. So now I am out over $20!

Worst app ever. Don't waste your time or money. This place offers several good promotions but when you try and use them they don't work. I've had this happen 3 times and when you speak to any csr they are rude and have to transfer you about 3 times only to tell you someone will reach out in 3-6 business days.

I got there trial membership. I was told I had until the 2nd. But they charged me on the 1st. Of course in the fine print it says I can't cancel within 48 hours of the renewal. Says I have to contact them for help. I can't find anywhere to talk to anyone on the app. Also it says nothing is refundable. So I was already charged ahead of the renewal date and stuck with it. After the month is up. I won't be using thier app anymore because of how shady thier business practice is.,"January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Misti Phillips,Google Play Store

I have never had to be refunded by a company so many times. Everytime other time I order food on uber eats the order gets canceled after the food has been picked up and it's so frustrating spending 50 dollars just to have to be refunded.

"The constant reminder to tip drivers when a) I've chosen not to tip them purposefully for various reasons. b) I ordered using priority delivery, thereby paying for delivery. It's patronising to have to he reminded 100 times. There are MANY negative things about Uber Eats and very FEW positives. Uber One is a savings but only by a smidge. There are no exclusive deals. In fact, many others get better deals in the same area and location. Customer retention needs a serious revisit!","December 11, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,D G,Google Play Store
"Prices are deceptive. They will raise the price of an item at a restaurant, and then give you a ""discount."" So the delivery fee is always high but hidden. Also, very disappointed in the customer service. Cancelled an order within 45 seconds and was charged the whole entire amount for the food. Was told I could not go get the food myself.

Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed.

"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order.

I had ordered a meal and it came back cold and the box it came in was squashed and tarnished. Overall I would not recommend using this app for any food deliveries","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Matshidiso Nukeri,Google Play Store
"would like to use this more but it's too expensive right now for me with extra fees on top of the service fee that doesn't show up until after you accept the order and the whole tipping thing here is quite pushy but there are some amazing restaurants, eateries on uber eats.","January 18, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Rachel Totman,Google Play Store
"App works alright. Had too many deliveries where I've either not received my full order, or received someone else's order. Need to do more to draw in more drivers - my area has a handful. Most don't work mornings making a breakfast delivery nigh impossible, and evening orders will normally bounce between a couple of them before being set, resulting in lukewarm food. Know who doesn't have that issue? Domino's, because they have dedicated drivers.","January 18, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Calum B,Google Play Store

"Every time I'm order, it's good. The system doesn't break down or anything but it'stoo much money. The tax goes way too high and the fee for just the food is insane.

"Uber Eats consistently recommends restaurants that are not local. This means food is not delivered hot, and you end up not being able to cancel orders because the restaurant will still charge the whole amount. There should be an option to limit the ditance within a 10 to 15-mile radius versus suggesting places 25 miles away. Ordering food should be easy and I shouldn't have to look up a ditance for suggested restaurants. Ridiculous!","December 3, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Caroline Sim,Google Play Store

I use this app way too often, even so, I rarely bother to contact CS when my orders are wrong or missing items because the issue is never addressed or honestly resolved. I've only ever been offered a partial refund/credit even when my entire order was wrong, no full refund or offer to have the order resent and exchanged.

That's 20-25% additional fee! This is different from the delivery fee which is fixed and fine but I hope this goes 100% straight to the delivery person or they're getting way out of hand on their greediness.

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible.

I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt.

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

Tried to do an add on order (which is supposed to be free delivery), got to the confirmation screen showing the amount I would be charged is $19.08, hit confirm and got charged $27.50 instead.

But two weeks ago I ordered groceries worth almost 70 euro and only got not even half of it. So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get? They just told me that they will not be able to refund me.

"Garbage app, food prices go up every week. Won't honor their own deals they push to you either. So many double deliveries that food is cold more often than not, even with paying for the membership. They also like to charge you twice when you decide to be nice and increase your tip, than try to hold the extra money for more than a week.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

"The app is ANNOYING. I can't select which notifications to turn on or off, so either I don't get notifications while I have a delivery in progress, or I get bombarded with advertisements every day.

There's nothing to update and I HAVE provided instructions, yet it keeps asking! Customer support couldn't help.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,k h,Google Play Store

I still find it very convenient in NY based in parking, gas etc. So I do utilize the service often. Especially, when they offer 40% OFF Groceries/Pets.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store
The map used by the app has gotten worse. Initially it was off by a few feet now it gives the delivery person a complete different location for drop off.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving. Today's issue is orders not completing because the app doesn't register that you've clicked ""everything looks good"" and perpetually loads. Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store

"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

"The app itself works great, but the service has dropped off a huge amount since I started using this. All of the hidden fees are ridiculous leading to outrageous prices. When the service sucks so bad, this is unacceptable. Lately, almost every time, I'm either missing items from my order, or my delivery is ""taking longer than expected"". Upsetting.

"They should rename this app ""Uber Missing Food"". Use it if you want to pay 10-15$ in delivery fees to nearly always have only a part of your order delivered. I stopped using this app awhile back because not only is it expensive, when something goes missing, you don't get compensation for the cost of the delivery fee, just the missing item. I had a craving today, but I regret using the app because I paid a good chunk extra to have half my order arrive.","January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Epifocol,Google Play Store
"for the most part this a great app, easy to use great selection of food choices to chose from and so on. However when it comes down to the total pricing of everything it's pretty wild. they over price everything and give minimal return to the driver while keeping a big portion of the price to themselves. they won't let you tip more than about half the total price which is complete BS.

"Ease of use is OK but you can't see what restaurants you've favourited very easily, you can't find them again very easily, and when orders go wrong it's not easy to resolve. Also, many uber eats drivers phones don't actually work so you can't call them when they don't drop the order at the right place which is really painful when you've waited over an hour for the food sometimes.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,M Anonymous,Google Play Store

"Terrible AI customer service in general, yet great service from the delivery drivers so far. The restaurants and stores don't have to replace missing items or inform you. They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives. I was charged Â£67 for 2 bottles of tonic. No logic in that whatsoever. Call your bank and report them.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

"Terrible company and customer service. Tried for several days to fight an unauthorized transaction on my account and they told me there was nothing they could do. Issue: I was charged twice for a tip. I tipped $5 (on a $17 bill) and my receipt showed tip X2 for $5 each totalling $10. Original receipt showed the single tip, then a second receipt came shortly after showing the double tip. I wrote out the issue, using pictures so customer service could understand, and it still confused them.","December 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kyle Kolebniak,Google Play Store

For being a one member there needs to be a help section that isn't a bot. Plus the deal's only save a few dollars and hardly ever changes from store to store. My card keeps coming up as low balance even though i have $169 and i can't ask for help because it's not on the help list at all. The problem is theres no help for anything else then what's on the help list already and there's only 4 options and only 1 leads to actually getting help from someone.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

"Placed an order and waited an hour until my order was cancelled by the app so no reason at all, I called the restaurant and they told me the driver had already picked up my order before it got cancelled. Thankfully the nice restaurant had our order remade and sent it to us WITHOUT uber and it was much faster, cheaper a more convenient. Just call to order this middle man app you don't need.

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this. As of recent, Uber's customer service has gotten much worse, making me fight for days and even forcing me take action with my bank in order to recover the money for stolen deliveries. This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing. Also they informed me that food quality was not there problem and would do nothing for me. Boo to you Uber.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Erica Keller,Google Play Store

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability. It's also easier to track your order and navigate.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

"Discounts mean basically nothing. 20% discounts up to $20 means you have to spend more than $50 to get the full $20 off. Feels slimy. Not to mention the poor customer service at times.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service. Mr Delivery it is.","December 19, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shaeera Essop,Google Play Store
"My food never arrived, I was on a night shift and didn't bring in food with me. I had a deal for 25%. Since it didn't come I had to reorder from a different restaurant and ended up having to pay more and having to wait 3 hours for food in total. And now just been charged for Uber one. I thought it was a free trial but it has came out of my bank account. No longer using Uber eats.","December 17, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joe,Google Play Store
"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service. Figure out a different way to ensure that food is securely delivered, or give the customer the option to opt out at their own risk.","December 20, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ryan Perry,Google Play Store
"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food. It seems that the delivery can get stuck at a delivery person but they can decide not to bother delivering while not cancelling your order. If they cancel the order you are left without food, they do not try to give your order to another delivery driver.","November 27, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Catherina Juyn,Google Play Store
"The App has major issues for me. They offer promotions but the app won't let me add or use them. If I have an issue with an order it is difficult to get resolved or refunded.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats.

Highly DO NOT recommend","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,heather berboth,Google Play Store
They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue.

Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays.

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

"Suggestions & Bugs: 1. Fix the irritating bug where the app randomly goes back to the main screen, no matter what you're doing, like browsing restaurants or placing an order. It's been doing this for at least a year 2. Lists! I have a million favorites. Would be helpful to be able to make a list of Breakfast, Dinner, etc, among just my favorites 3.

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

"Horrible! Incredibly disappointing customer service. Always delivering late. Even with priority delivery payed. You would think a big company would do better.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so... Like I said, Pros and Cons. Uber customer support is usually okay, even though my orders are regularly messed up.","January 6, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Freddy Mayo,Google Play Store

The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

"Too expensive now. too many fees. Dislike the ""small cart"" fee. Update: 1 star now you get a small order fee under $15 forcing you to overspend when you just want to order something small to eat at work.

I was then told to wait for the order to post, when it did they said its been over an hour after delivery and I can no longer add a tip.

"It's great for what it's supposed to do and they offer wonderful deals and discounts all the time, but when a order is messed up or not delivered they stop offering a refund after a certain amount of time. I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money.

"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

"Supervisor Jude instructed me to reinstall the app in order to fix a restaurant's improperly entered menu. Problem exists on your end, not mine, duh. So, if I want to order food that's listed and get the appropriate price, I can't use this app on my phone, tablet or website since the menu itself is incorrect. This has gone unresolved for about 2 months.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food.

At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store

Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later.

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

My experience was so bad I completely deleted my account and app.,"January 8, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kenton Tran,Google Play Store
The support pages in the app are absolutely abysmal to try and navigate. I hope for the same of your sanity you never have an issue. The fees are getting less concise and predictable. App is a little bit glitchy and unintuitive when looking through food menus. Not sure why there's even an option to tip before delivery. What if the delivery driver was bad?,"January 1, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mitch,Google Play Store
"I used the reorder button to order something I had done previously. I have used the reorder button to order this same item previously. This time, mysteriously, it ordered the meat version of the vegetarian entree I had always ordered. The vegetarian option had vanished from the app. After getting the wrong order from the restaurant, I checked -- they still offered the item. Uber did the wrong thing, and has ghosted my support conversation. No responses in over a week. Terrible service.","December 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nikhil Gajwani,Google Play Store
"I have roughly 20-30 places near me that I can order from and Uber One does not cut any delivery fees from a single one of them... It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived? Service fee hikes in price when you get deals/promos.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,rin kagamine,Google Play Store

"There are many unreliable drivers and no way to properly get help with the order other than cancelling. I've had meals that are picked up and then the driver cancels after I've waited over an hour. I've paid for priority delivery only to watch the driver drive to a completely different area of the city, extending the delivery time before making the delivery.

"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food. While the delivery service by itself is convenient, I feel I should never be paying $40 for a meal that is only $12.99.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Love Of Nikki (ForTheLoveOfNikki),Google Play Store

When the service sucks so bad, this is unacceptable. Lately, almost every time, I'm either missing items from my order, or my delivery is ""taking longer than expected"". Upsetting.

They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store

"It's convenient and really reliable, very good selection of restaurants. But it's expensive. The fees, then tip, and they also increase the prices of the food higher than what the actual restaurants charge if you went there or ordered takeout. The price of convenience I guess. If you add something to your car and don't check out they'll give you 40% off coupons so I recommend just manipulating the app for it to get you coupons and then only use it when you have 40% off coupons to cancel out fees","December 10, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,matt parish,Google Play Store

Driver called me to ask if I was there, so I walked down to confirm and he was not. 5 minutes later, I get a notification and picture saying it's been delivered... somewhere else. Called the driver, they responded saying they went where instructed and mentioned the wrong address. Contacted support and they said ""sorry"". Not acceptable service.","December 27, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Greg Kraska,Google Play Store
Uber Eats app is utterly disorganized and user unfriendly. It's geared for max profit to UE regardless of customer satisfaction. Help is not easily accessible which is unfair business practice. I had mis counts between cart and payment; not easy to check or remove items before payment is processed .

"I have no idea how they still have a 4.4 overall rating when a quick scroll displays ENTIRELY poor reviews. Wish I could rate a 0 star. I canceled an order immediately after placing it, and they refused my refund because ""the store had accepted the order"". They also refused to actually send the delivery. So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie NegrÃµn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order.

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this.

This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently.

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

"Honestly ""Customer service"" is a joke. I use this app way too often, even so, I rarely bother to contact CS when my orders are wrong or missing items because the issue is never addressed or honestly resolved. I've only ever been offered a partial refund/credit even when my entire order was wrong, no full refund or offer to have the order resent and exchanged. Worst of all is every time I receive a partial refund, they charge the exact same amount to my account meaning they scam your refunds","November 8, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Jonathan,Google Play Store
"Usefull app indeed but recently they're ripping more than they should. It's not enough they already added 10-15% more to the price of a product, they'll ask for ANOTHER 10% for ""service"" fee. That's 20-25% additional fee! This is different from the delivery fee which is fixed and fine but I hope this goes 100% straight to the delivery person or they're getting way out of hand on their greediness. What a rip-off.","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,RenceDRenz,Google Play Store
"The app has some annoying bugs but its fine, the problem is with the customer service, if anything goes wrong with your order then you are helpless.

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

The food items are 30-40% more expensive than if you went there in person and on top of all that you jave to pay services fee, taxes and delivery fee.

I've been having the worst exp.I referred my friend and got a promo code. But when I try to order using the code it says your account doesn't have permission to use these codes. There's no way to appeal this and later your promotions disappear. The app would not let you order using any promo codes.. Went hungry because of this and resorted to using other apps for ordering.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers).

Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service.

"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service.

"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

I use Uber one to help with those fees and, in some cases, still can be $4 for ""taxes and fees"" on a $20 order.

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food.

"I wanted to view the total of price order before I ordered, so I went to the only page that showed it, saw the price, and I was like hell no but it ""force ordered"" for me without any option to cancel order and without me fully consenting. At least with door dash I get to see what my total is going to be beforehand. Yes, I was going to compare the price between the apps, but ffs this is a sneaky tactic to grab extra money out of people - Hiding the pricing on last page/force ordering it for you.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Kyle Knitter,Google Play Store

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store

Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly.

I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order.

I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied.

We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

"I used the reorder button to order something I had done previously. I have used the reorder button to order this same item previously. This time, mysteriously, it ordered the meat version of the vegetarian entree I had always ordered. The vegetarian option had vanished from the app. After getting the wrong order from the restaurant, I checked -- they still offered the item. Uber did the wrong thing, and has ghosted my support conversation. No responses in over a week. Terrible service.","December 14, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nikhil Gajwani,Google Play Store
"I have roughly 20-30 places near me that I can order from and Uber One does not cut any delivery fees from a single one of them... It's overly expensive, most of the delivery fees are between $11-15 and that is not including the extra service fee (which the driver only gets 1% of), tax or driver tip included. Why pay for the subscription, let alone use the app at all, if 1 or none of the places near you even gets the delivery fees waived? Service fee hikes in price when you get deals/promos.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,rin kagamine,Google Play Store

"There are many unreliable drivers and no way to properly get help with the order other than cancelling. I've had meals that are picked up and then the driver cancels after I've waited over an hour. I've paid for priority delivery only to watch the driver drive to a completely different area of the city, extending the delivery time before making the delivery.

"Uber eats is super expensive, and honestly, I want to know where the ""other fees"" actually go to. Also, I've noticed that when I go to stores to order food, the prices are $5-$7 cheaper. So not only is Uber eats charging an arm and a leg for fees we are not sure of, but they're also hiking the prices for the food. While the delivery service by itself is convenient, I feel I should never be paying $40 for a meal that is only $12.99.","January 17, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Love Of Nikki (ForTheLoveOfNikki),Google Play Store

When the service sucks so bad, this is unacceptable. Lately, almost every time, I'm either missing items from my order, or my delivery is ""taking longer than expected"". Upsetting.

They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives.

Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't.

"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store

Uber Eats app is utterly disorganized and user unfriendly. It's geared for max profit to UE regardless of customer satisfaction. Help is not easily accessible which is unfair business practice.

"I have no idea how they still have a 4.4 overall rating when a quick scroll displays ENTIRELY poor reviews. Wish I could rate a 0 star. I canceled an order immediately after placing it, and they refused my refund because ""the store had accepted the order"". They also refused to actually send the delivery. So they just kept my money for nothing. I've never experienced this and it's unacceptable. Trash way to conduct business.","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ashley Hood,Google Play Store
Overall a major net positive in my life. Always a decent coupon and they virtually always (eventually) work out the problems if there are any.

"The app needs some sort of way of taking notes on your order so you can easily remember which food was god awful and which food was delicious. Also needs more fine control on the emails as it's like the boy who cried wolf - I got so many I had to turn them off entirely as I was constantly being spammed. Could also use a neutral option for meals and delivery reviews. I had a bad delivery, but not really bad enough to give him a bad review and potentially affect his earnings.","November 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ryan King,Google Play Store
"I like how easy it is to navigate the app and the prices vs other delivery services, but they won't refund you after a certain amount of times even if they dispatch drivers who give you the wrong order or ignore instructions. I have mixed feelings for uber eats because I have a habit of wanting to oder food especially because I don't have a car to go pick up food but a lot of the uber eats drivers either don't understand English or don't follow instructions or give you the wrong food.","January 13, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Melanie NegrÃµn,Google Play Store
"I tried Uber One and it was awesome, until they added extra fees for bags and such. Sometimes adding an item will incur an extra fee for the extra bag charge. And the explanation for charges is vague. Not paying delivery fee was cool, but the other fees added up. My Uber One expired because I did not want to pay full price for it. Now UberEats is expensive 30 bucks +tip, for a local sandwich is too much. The app already increases the regular menu price. Being squeezed for money is not fun.","January 6, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Brandon Neal,Google Play Store
Really dissapointed to see the quality has really gone down hill over the last 6 months. From a severe lack of communication from drivers to picking up wrong orders or spilling the contents all throughout the bags to just parking up for an hour and waiting for you to cancel an order. I have asked for more refunds and cancelled orders in the last month than i have in the entire year. Thoroughly upset,"December 8, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jordan G,Google Play Store

"The app is functional but drivers are unreliable, since the drivers are third-party, there are thieves, liars and conmen among them. My food has been stolen multiple times over the years, and in the past, Uber would refund this.

This is unacceptable customer service, I recommend you use a different app.","December 23, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eddie Hilton,Google Play Store
"I've ordered many times through this app. Uber Eats definitely takes longer than other similar services but it hasn't affected food quality until recently. I paid for Express last time and it took well over an hour. When trying to reach out to Uber they told me it arrived 8 min early, referring to a time frame that kept changing.

I've used DoorDash and Grubhub and this by far is better as far as reimbursement if your order doesn't show (which happens less frequently than the others) and reliability.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery.

Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already?

"Honestly ""Customer service"" is a joke. I use this app way too often, even so, I rarely bother to contact CS when my orders are wrong or missing items because the issue is never addressed or honestly resolved. I've only ever been offered a partial refund/credit even when my entire order was wrong, no full refund or offer to have the order resent and exchanged. Worst of all is every time I receive a partial refund, they charge the exact same amount to my account meaning they scam your refunds","November 8, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Jonathan,Google Play Store
"Usefull app indeed but recently they're ripping more than they should. It's not enough they already added 10-15% more to the price of a product, they'll ask for ANOTHER 10% for ""service"" fee. That's 20-25% additional fee! This is different from the delivery fee which is fixed and fine but I hope this goes 100% straight to the delivery person or they're getting way out of hand on their greediness. What a rip-off.","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,RenceDRenz,Google Play Store
"The app has some annoying bugs but its fine, the problem is with the customer service, if anything goes wrong with your order then you are helpless.

The support service is criminal. It is an absolute joke and impossible to get any support or log into your account if you lose your credit that was linked to your Uber account.

The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something.

I've been having the worst exp.I referred my friend and got a promo code. But when I try to order using the code it says your account doesn't have permission to use these codes. There's no way to appeal this and later your promotions disappear. The app would not let you order using any promo codes.. Went hungry because of this and resorted to using other apps for ordering. Absolutely worst experience. Especially after you take time to finally decide what you want ro order and this happens.

"For food delivery services, I find this is one of the better ones. Because they have to get your pin from you to drop it off, you don't get any instances of them just leaving your order in the wrong place and then lying about being unable to reach you (like I've personally experienced with some extremely stupid and awful Doordash drivers). Would recommend for this reason alone.","November 5, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,mio rom,Google Play Store
Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work. It actually costs me more money because although I save on delivery paying for the premium it is costing me more than the vouchers were giving me in discounts. Otherwise the service is pretty good.,"November 29, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Daniel Laws,Google Play Store
"Used to be okay. Now you get high charges, bad drivers and anxiety over fixing their mistakes. Most recent I've received a double charge for a tip that wasn't even deserved, with items missing.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite. I don't believe I've ever had a late issue.","January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kai Nicholas,Google Play Store
"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service.

"The main reason I use this app is that I can request that the drivers leave my food at the door, and I can grab it after without having to worry about meeting the driver at exactly the moment they arrive. Lately I've been being forced to provide the drivers a pin number every single time I order which completely negates the reason I use this service.

"Deliveries can take any amount of time. The time indicated in the app is useless. Sometimes I wait 2+ hours for my food.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Not an issue experienced with any of their competitors (who offer far better customer service). The more people aware of their unfair practices the better.,"November 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mark Papworth,Google Play Store
"You can order items and take a picture of your entire order, items to be missing and be told ""We understand this has been inconvenient and are sorry to hear this has been such a poor experience for you. However, we are not in a position to offer a price adjustment or compensation for this order."" So you don't get any type of refund for the food you paid for but did not receive. They will only repeat the same message without explaining why they can not refund the missing item(s).

Possibly the worst customer service I've ever experienced my entire life. There was a malfunction in the app that overcharged and it took 20 days of robo customer service responses to finally reach a human being to resolve this. There is no customer service phone number. And the only way that you can actually escalate things is to request that multiple times and after weeks someone might give you a call. Never ordering from them ever again.

It's more expensive than the other apps. Ordered a meal that came to 61 dollars minus a 15 dollar discount I have that's 46 dollars. I go to GrubHub and input the same items for the same restaurant without discounts and it costs 52 dollars. That's ridiculous without a discount that's a 9 dollar difference.,"January 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Quentin McInnis,Google Play Store

I followed those steps and Uber has refused my refund and I am unable to open a support ticket with a person to resolve this.

That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour.

"The platform had a bug which led to the initiation of a wrong order. After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

"Horrible app UX when it comes to placing the second order after the first! They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"Communication between the app (Uber) and the restaurants is not consistently accurate, customization is no longer available in many cases, Uber is very hesitant to refund when errors occur and often refers back to the restaurant who will send you back to Uber, and on and on with no good solution.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot. So now 3 of my last 5 orders the drivers just said they can't delivery and take the food and go.

"Support is terrible. Often they will advise there is nothing they can do, or to wait further for extremely late orders but thank you for your understanding, and will end the chat abruptly.

They have a terrible system where they just keep moving back the estimated delivery and the latest delivery, then when you try to reach support about your food being late they just say sorry. Meanwhile I'm trying to be nice and not get a refund so the restaurant doesn't take a hit for Ubers lack of service.

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy. Couldn't recommend it more!","December 16, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Theo Cann,Google Play Store
"Absolutely horrid, I'm never using UberEats again. I ordered for a delivered. The driver picked up my order. It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store
"My order request never arrived at the restaurant. The uber app functioned as nornal, and driver quit everytime they arrived at the drive through window. Ny 5th driver decided to inform me they never received my order request. I cancelled and was charged for an order that would never have arrived. Multiple drivers were wasting their time going there. The app also didn't inform me of a fee when i chose to cancel at that moment. Uber support completely ignored and disregarded the main issue.","January 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dale B,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time.

They will steal your money! Refused to refund items not received. Said I had too many problems with orders. IT'S NOT MY FAULT that about 1 in 4 orders are missing items or have incorrect items. Don't dare complain about issues with your order or you'll be punished. If they took the time to look at my account they would see that I spend a lot of money ordering from Uber Eats.

I understand people might take advantage of the refund policy, but it is frustrating when your food gets forgotten or made incorrectly, and Uber eats won't give you back your money. You are forced into a situation where you don't have food and you lose your money.","November 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Kristina Mckeehan,Google Play Store
"They falsely advertised that I could use a 50% off coupon. It was literally on the order before the driver started shopping. Then, once the shopping started, they took it off. So I contacted customer service so they could fix it. Now they say I have to wait for the order to be completed in order to fix it. Now,the order is completed, and they ask for a screenshot of the coupon. That literally doesn't make sense because the customer would have to be expecting that you wouldn't honor the coupon.","December 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alivia,Google Play Store
"Usually, this app is okay but I'm getting increasingly annoyed with how many times an order has something missing or wrong. Also, they should make restaurants include food allergy warning for certain foods. I just ordered something that never specified that there was seafood in it and I had to spit it out. I just wasted my money on something that could've made me violently ill. I hardly like to complain but this is ridiculous. This app is overly pricey and most of the time not even worth it.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Alondra Vidal,Google Play Store
Terrible customer service and incorrect description for groceries. I ordered clementines. The description showed 5 lbs but you had to enter the count. The grocery shopper got one based on the count. I was incorrectly charged and the agent lied saying i would receive an updated receipt within 24 hours which never occurred. When I contacted them again they said they cant issue a refund. I disputed with Paypal and won. Now the app wont let me place an order until I pay the amount back.,"November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Amy Gomanie,Google Play Store
Made an order and paid the rider cash through Mpesa following the rider's instructions. Rider turned around and reported that I had not made the payment and the app pegged the receipt amount to my app as an unpaid bill. Issue with the rider is one problem.

The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour.

"I downloaded your app just so I could leave a review telling y'all that you need to stop accepting orders from places who have their own delivery staff. It's bad enough that you let people get away with not tipping people who work for you directly, but now you're taking money away from people who don't even work for you.

"Quality of drivers has plummeted. Used this multiple times a day for years, past 6 months it's weekly issues. Most recently a driver just didn't deliver the order, said he left it at my front door, the delivery picture showed he hadn't left it at all- it was my front door with nothing near it AT ALL, no help from uber support. Wouldn't even contact driver to see where he ""left it"". Wouldn't let me edit the tip.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day. Biggest issue is with drivers but that's not really ubers fault. This is so much better than calling a restaurant only for them to not write it down correct or for me to forget to order something.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Ubereats is a great app for food ordering. Very reliable service and intuitive app. Very good customer service that is always willing to help if there are any issues with orders. I do enjoy the option to be able to have my order delivered with priority for a small fee. I also like the fact that sometimes I get an option to add on a second order and have them both delivered at the same time. Many great choices of restaurants available in the app. I've been using Ubereats for the last 3 years.,"November 9, 2023",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,REXXone REXXone,Google Play Store
"The worst experience ever! Highway robbery, especially when it comes to supermarkets & pharmacies. You'll be charged fees for canceling an order early even though most items are out of stock which you're only told about an hour later and the delivery person hasn't left the store yet. You'll still be charged even though you've received nothing. They don't speak English & are difficult to understand. Disgusting, pathetic, & bad for business!

"So I get a promo code for delivery and discount food. When I tried to use it and order food it says I needed to be verified through Facebook, I don't verify myself from social media, so I called 2 days straight and finally heard back after 3 days.

"No customer service, poor communication, not possible contact with the delivery person. Uber eats do not care, stores do not care and even less drive would care.

Uber does not(or if they do they do a terrible job) quality check the restaurants they sign on to their service. They do not allow you to speak to someone to make complaints.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route. Can't be a coincidence. I only use Uber for lack of alternatives, it was a subpar experience before but it's gotten downright awful.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anna Niedbala,Google Play Store

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

Tried to do an add on order (which is supposed to be free delivery), got to the confirmation screen showing the amount I would be charged is $19.08, hit confirm and got charged $27.50 instead.

But two weeks ago I ordered groceries worth almost 70 euro and only got not even half of it. So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get? They just told me that they will not be able to refund me.

"Garbage app, food prices go up every week. Won't honor their own deals they push to you either. So many double deliveries that food is cold more often than not, even with paying for the membership. They also like to charge you twice when you decide to be nice and increase your tip, than try to hold the extra money for more than a week.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

"The app is ANNOYING. I can't select which notifications to turn on or off, so either I don't get notifications while I have a delivery in progress, or I get bombarded with advertisements every day.

There's nothing to update and I HAVE provided instructions, yet it keeps asking! Customer support couldn't help.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,k h,Google Play Store

I still find it very convenient in NY based in parking, gas etc. So I do utilize the service often. Especially, when they offer 40% OFF Groceries/Pets.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store
The map used by the app has gotten worse. Initially it was off by a few feet now it gives the delivery person a complete different location for drop off.

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving. Today's issue is orders not completing because the app doesn't register that you've clicked ""everything looks good"" and perpetually loads. Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection). It would be handy to have the add/remove option next to each menu item, instead of having to navigate to a separate page to make the selection.

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

I last used this app in 2020 and now I remember why. Tonight I've lost money because they have no customer service. All directions they give on their app lead to nothing. You go round in circles. After several attempts to contact their driver who cancelled our order due to being unable to deliver it turns out he wasn't even at the right address but there is noone to contact for that. They just concluded he could not deliver hence no refund. Rubbish app as rubbish service. Deleted.,"November 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheryl Nyabezi,Google Play Store

"Pretty much always 40% off promos! and seemingly, you get an offer for a 3 month free trial of uber one every 4-5 months and after your trial ends and you cancel the membership they offer you a discounted month subscription for $0.99!

"1st 2 orders were horrible experiences. FIRST order I did, I applied the coupon. Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee. SECOND order, 3 drivers canceled on me, so uber eats canceled my order then gave me a cancelation fee. I wasn't even the one who canceled it!","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Aubry,Google Play Store
"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price. It's not just the fees that UberEats displays. Those extra fees are built into the menu pricing you see in the app. It gets close to 2x as expensive as going in person in most cases.","January 2, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caleb,Google Play Store

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Some restaurants are more expensive but you will just have to sift through some to get a good deal on food and pricing but otherwise its a good app. They do refund you money if you've been waiting for a driver for over 2-6 hrs but it's not an everyday thing and I'd imagine there is some communication problems, but that can always be fixed.","November 26, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Veronica Boaza,Google Play Store

When I was about to cancel, the condition says that I won't get a refund since the food was already prepared. I can't cancel while the driver can? How is that fair? And then somehow my order eventually got canceled, when I tried to click the notification, it's already gone. Worst app.","January 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Monica Fe,Google Play Store

Uber may have a wide range of restaurants, but their help is terrible compared to Doordash, I have to wait 3-5 business days for them to release a hold on my money, too bad I was trying to eat today.

Awful. Extremely upcharged for ever item. Always shows up 30-1 hrs late past the estimated time. Drivers accept orders then don't move to collect orders.

Food items that don't arrive and I'm still charged for them even though the restaurants tell me to ask for refund.

"While customer service is always great, im giving this 3/5 due to repreated issues with grocery fulfillment. Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk). The level of involvement and refunding to get maybe half my order makes this app not useful at all.

They handle customers service terribly and they make you wait 2 +hours just to find out they canceled your order. And then they don't want to refund you the money because it is an inconvenience.

Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible. Drivers also seem to be rarely checked out by uber (different person turns up to who is registered) so security/safety issues.

Don't like the fact u can't get a refund unless u take a picture and it takes a second for u to be able to rate so u can go back to ur receipt and say something is wrong by then my foods cold. I haven't been able to get refunds because it takes so long for Uber to load the rating stuff to be able to go to the receipt.

"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store

That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson).

I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold).

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined.

"It's expensive , you're paying at least like 10-12 mote bucks than if you bought it at the actual restaurant. Uber one saves money but not much. They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function. I dont like the fact that some places have inconsistent menus listed so it makes buying food slightly more annoying than it should be but hey, this is the price of convenience. My biggest issue is simply the over the top fees even with uber one.","December 23, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ration,Google Play Store
"App is easy to use. An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund. I lost 48$ I hope door dash doesn't do this nonsense.","January 14, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,kikyo jewel,Google Play Store

A summary showing the total cost of the order before you shoot the trigger is absent, is it buried somewhere?

I've tried multiple approaches to try and get it right with no success, entering the address makes it seem correct but then the GPS directions given to the drivers is wrong.

Constant problems with app. Notifications never go to what you want. It always reloads the Uber Eats starting page and you have to manually navigate back to where the notification was supposed to take you. Especially annoying when attempting to rate an order. Help is utterly useless and fixes nothing. Keeps deleting my home address and there's no way to fix it so everyone just gets lost when delivering. No support number to call. Also can't unsubscribe to Uber One because it hid the option.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Todd Turner,Google Play Store

Mostly a good app with a good choice of restaurants to choose from. However I had a personal account and business account with them and I used to pay alot of money each month for Uber taxis and so on but I had many problems with my account with them and I could not even speak with someone by the telephone.

"Had a new user promotion leaflet and went through the whole process only to have the promo code rejected right at the end. Total marketing disaster and I'm left without dinner. Very much a bait and switch technique to get you to engage with the app, apply the promotion and then have it rejected right at the end as you are about to pay hoping that you'll pay full proce having gone through the account set up.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants. A $10 item/meal came out to be $20 BEFORE a tip. This is ridiculous.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

It should be easier to filter out the things I have zero chance of ordering.,"December 24, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A Andrew,Google Play Store

The delivery time kept on increasing. The order which was to delivered increased by an hour. I hope it was because of my payment issues.

"If at all possible order and pick up your own food. If you choose delivery (and you don't want an Uber One subscription), Uber charges a delivery fee AND a service fee. They actually charge the customer extra money for providing delivery service of the food, and that's the whole idea behind the app smh. You order, and your food is either delivered or you pick it up.

Be careful because even when I checkout, my 10 euro promo seemed to apply, but the app took the money off of my account without using the voucher. It was according to every rule they had.

However, I'm gonna rate it 2 stars because customer support says that they won't grant us a refund for a specific order, that was missing an item, because they looked into my account and said I asked for too many refunds for missing items.

Which means they're taking your money for no reason and expecting you to accept it to pad their profits. Any corporation run in this manner should be regulated out of existence; I will never touch Uber again.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dalai Whitehorn,Google Play Store
"It's good when it's good but hits ground hard when trying to solve issues. Few to many issues with being charged using Uber cash, then orders canceled, and having to get things sorted is super frustrating. Right now, I've been charged $197, and the order got canceled 10 minutes in. I now have next to nothing in Uber Cash and can't even order again from another store because no refund nor history of the order being placed because it didn't get to complete.

"Been using them loyally for 2-3 years. Only recently subbed on UberOne. I notice that the promos are much less since. My biggest beef apart from it's taking longer to receive orders, even when I pay for priority is their policy on refunds. It's very common for me to receive my grocery order incomplete. It's usually 1-2 items. Sometimes worse. The bot response refunds, I receive Â£ eventually. Tonight they've refused based on high level of claims. I'm expected to take the hit on cost.

Uber eats food delivery. Is very terrible because when you order the food you expected the driver to go pick it up at a certain time and the time keeps on extending and extending and extending. The first time it says it's supposed to be picked up with 6:30pm. now the order is saying it won't be picked up until 7:05pm.

I had signed up for Uber One and decided on paying the $9.99 monthly membership, only to find out that it had somehow been changed to the annual $99.99 membership without my permission. Then, to make things worse when I tried to delete my account, I was told there's a back balance due for an amount I was supposed to be refunded. Based on principle alone, I'm never using this app again.","December 21, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,James Gonzales,Google Play Store
"Only minor complaints about the app. First, there should be a better system for restaurants to communicate they are (temporarily?) out of a sauce or dressing before placing an order. There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order. Second, U feel taxes and fees should be separate. Third, some restaurants report order is ready 10-15 minutes before it is","December 7, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Jon Best,Google Play Store

"Uber eats basically stole from me. I placed an order, and it said the order failed to send through and that I have to try again. I placed another order and it went through, and then a few minutes later my first order corrected itself and withdrew money. It did not notify me until I opened the app around 15 minutes later.

After a while, I was getting the wrong order more often than not, and after discussing this with customer service, they claimed that they could not return my money or issue a credit, but that they would be in a word to the restaurant on what to do better next time. That was highly irritating, especially when it was a safety issue with half cooked food.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dana Bowman,Google Play Store

After that I was ignored. Thanks a lot for helping yourself to some of my Christmas gift and refusing to return it when it's clearly a duplicate charge. Never had to leave a review like this before in my life. If it happened once, I'm assuming you steal quite a lot from your customers.

"Their service fees are sometimes very inconsistent for no explainable reason.

Don't dare complain about issues with your order or you'll be punished. If they took the time to look at my account they would see that I spend a lot of money ordering from Uber Eats.

Horrible app for food! I cancelled an order immediately after submitting bc it automatically charged the wrong card (it doesn't even give you an option to select payment method).

"Pre-tipping required or drivers decline to bring your order, occasional 40% Discounts to stores that increase their prices by 50%+ for Uber eats orders, have to pay extra for direct delivery, literally every restaurant adds 30% to 50% extra on all menu items.

"Up until lately, ordering from uber eats was great. But after so many delivery mistakes and working through the hassle of getting refunded, they decide to keep your money instead. Example: I ordered some food with drinks. Drinks were forgotten at the restaurant. The driver refused to go back and get them.

I've not had a problem until today but it was a huge problem. Support is non existent and because of this 4 drivers had their time wasted and there was literally nothing that any of us could do about it. I tried to contact support to sort it out and was told they would get back to me within 8 to 12 hours. This is utterly ridiculous.

I can understand having a delivery fee if your driver is driving an excessive amount of miles to drop your food off. That's no big deal. Then there was a freaking service fee that was almost $10 on top of the delivery fee, %25 tip I left, and taxes. What the hell is a service fee? This should be more clear.

Do not purchase the premium. Uber eats gives you occasional vouchers and promotions which work until you pay for the premium service. As soon as I started to pay for premium none of my vouchers that they emailed me work anymore. They still email me the vouchers but they no longer work.

"If you like ordering food, look no further. It's pretty good; it's your standard delivery service. The only flaw is the flaw of all delivery apps, which I think is beyond their control: the food prices are increased for some unknown reason to me. I can only assume it's because we don't have immediate access to a regular menu, so we cannot compare. But given this is a gripe with all delivery apps, Uber Eats is consistently my favourite.

"Uber Eats is an absolute rip-off. If Uber wants a driver to deliver 2 or 3 orders in a 15 minute order space, the driver waits at the restaurant while your order gets cold before leaving. On top of that, if you don't pay for priority (which I always do now), you are stone last. So an order they advertise as 25 minutes can take an hour. They blame it on the restaurants, but I've called several restaurants who are equally as frustrated. Total rip off & terrible service.

If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house. Also the fees are over priced making it hard to tip the drivers that deserve it (the ones that don't steal).,"December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angel Boling,Google Play Store
"$11 service fee?? The order is already $31 (originally $53 before discounts), and they expect me to pay an extra $11? Apparently for ""basket size and cost related to the uber.""

"Only issue is the items on Uber eats are more expensive when you use Uber eats then when you go to the store to buy items. Also in some restaurants, you will order a meal. Then find out that it doesn't even come with a drink. The drinks are like 5 bucks, but they want to call it a meal. That is false advertising ð¯. I left door dash and started using uber eats because of these same reasons. Uber eats is still better than doordash but this is ridiculous. Makes me not want to use this app.","January 10, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,WOoBIE,Google Play Store
One of the worst customer service support you can get. You get put on hold and be told to hold on the link for 2 min which then turns into 20 min and the rep does not decide to join back on the call or you keep getting bounced 8 times. EIGHT times for someone to work on your issue or problem. Even then it's half effort being put in and the issue not being resolved,"January 10, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Arsalan Sheikh,Google Play Store

A driver stole the food, sat in the restaurant parking lot for 30+ minutes. marked the order ""delivered"" and attached a photo of the inside of their car. Uber eats support did literally nothing, refused to refund or anything at all, and then closed the order and disallowed any further contact with support for the order.

"I cannot stress how much I HATE! DETEST! LOATH! The quality of the restaurants on this app! If you're in Kenya, order nothing from any restaurant with the words KILIMANI in the name. Uber does not(or if they do they do a terrible job) quality check the restaurants they sign on to their service. They do not allow you to speak to someone to make complaints. The system they have is not nearly nuanced enough to allow you to say how you were ripped off by a restaurant.

There was an issue one time with a restaurant that sold me undercooked chicken at 11 p.m., and the full-price refund was processed after 2 days. Which was great, in a way.","January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,marielle recentes,Google Play Store

Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes.

"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange!

I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy.

Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop.

I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time.

They accept your orders even if you're left with a few items. They then charge you again for the new order without a refund. It's a primitive AI app made by theives. I was charged Â£67 for 2 bottles of tonic. No logic in that whatsoever. Call your bank and report them. Delete your account while you still can.","November 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jasmin Bjorvand,Google Play Store
"This app used to be really good. Now I find it deceptive and sneaky just like other delivery apps. Now, It's just another business seemingly trying to screw people over and then making it extremely hard to be compensated. If my delivery is late, own up to it, do something about it. It doesn't have to be a full refund or free food. But do something. You promise a service at the start stick with it. If you can't, don't. It is really that simple. just paid $44 for cold, soggy food. Not 1st time","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Brenden,Google Play Store
"Good App but there is downside. There's a time if your payment is Declined, the app will still submit the order. Even if you cancel the order, since it's processed in that second, you will pay the cancelation fee. Which is 90% price of the total order. That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store
"This app is fraudulent. I've been an Uber One member for almost a decade and items are missing every other order. When you try to request support, an automated message pops up that your order isn't eligible for refunds. When you text customer service, they copy and paste that same message. Use another food app. At least they won't take your money and not give the items you paid for.","December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shamima Begum,Google Play Store

Tried to do an add on order (which is supposed to be free delivery), got to the confirmation screen showing the amount I would be charged is $19.08, hit confirm and got charged $27.50 instead.

So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get?

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

In uber you pick where to meet the person. On this you put the address's and your app gets it completely wrong. It shows the correct address untill the driver picks up the food. Than for no reason it changes it to the side street to me which has been closed for 2 years now due to a giant road upgrade. It ignores the address I put in and just tries to gps the closest spot.

I have noticed recently It's become harder to communicate with someone about your order which is the reason for 4 stars.,"December 17, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shannon Lorenzen,Google Play Store
"Complete garbage app and service. Never got my order. I've been at home all day and no one showed up with my food BUT you did charge me 102CA$... No easy of contacting you.

"Don't even know where to start with how poor this service is: if in order to get food from restaurants that is actually still hot you have to pay for priority delivery on top of regular (an extra Â£3!), more grocery orders are cancelled (without any explanation or compensation) than are fulfilled, substituted items are chosen without any thought at all, the latest delivery time is constantly being pushed back so that they don't have to honour the Â£5 compensation for late delivery. It goes on.","November 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mark Horrocks,Google Play Store
Just a fare warning. I have only been using the app for about a week and have already been ripped off. First time I was overcharged on my bill and had to spend about 24 hours writing back and forth to get an appropriate refund. Second time I was double charged and have yet to receive a refund. Called my bank and they immediately informed me that every week they have a high number of complaints from customers with similar issues.

"I honestly don't know why I continue to use this app. I had written a review 4 years ago, and nothing has changed. Somehow they suck me back in, and nothing has changed. The fees are ridiculous, even with UberOne. It was near impossible to get to talk to an actual person for support, and when I did they were basically like a bot anyway. I think at this point it is cheaper and easier to just order from the individual restaurant apps.","January 7, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sara Morse,Google Play Store
"Getting worse. Untrustworthy. There needs to be a better vetting process. Multiple times I have ordered and gotten my order canceled. I have gotten some great service from some vendors but those bad ones stick out. Issues with food quality (cold, undercooked, not cooked to specification, wrong ingredients) never get resolved. Also apparently nothing is ever worthy of a refund. I'm a uberOne subscriber but about to cancel if this continues.","November 10, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Z Med,Google Play Store

Avoid at any costs. Last night I order food through the app. I live on the second floor. In the app I instructed that they have to press the buzzer so I can let them in so they can deliver at my door. Was waiting for the delivery guy at the window and he was running late. On my phone there were 2 missed calls when I checked so I tried to call the number back. No connection to that number. In the app it was saying that my food had been delivered. So I ended up with no food and no money. Shame,"November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Patricia Almeida,Google Play Store
"This app is laughably bad. Just about everytime I order, the convenience of it is completely undone by some absolutely brain dead issue that just should not happen or your order never arriving.

Absolutely moronic design.","December 24, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bill Clinton's lolita,Google Play Store
"The list of restaurants could be better organized (by name or distance). The menus tend to be a bit glitchy (e.g. scrolling up after making a selection).

"Been using this app for a very long time. Lots of ups and downs. There are pros and cons to it all. On one hand (and it's a pretty big hand) the cost of everything is so high- especially on Delivery apps! On the other, Uber gives you promos and coupons (if you're a member it seems.), but they're also removing the benefit of giving you $5 in Uber cash if your order is late now so...

"The go-to app for any late night snackers or parties looking for a quick meal. The app also has the largest number of partnerships in comparison to its contemporaries, so you can find a lot more in variety of options as well, which can absolutely make it the better choice for those who have certain diet requirements or habits. Further to this, you can now order groceries through the app as well which is great for those who, like myself, are massively lazy.

It was taking a while, so I checked the app and it said they were running late due to another order. A few minutes later, my order was canceled by the driver. 1st, why can they accept another order while actively delivering mine? 2nd, why does the driver have the ability to cancel my order when they have my food already? They just stole my food and support didn't seem to care at all.","December 2, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kay,Google Play Store

There are a couple of restaurants that I know of that seem to be consistently out of blue cheese dressing, yet I won't know about it until I get my order.

Had an issue with a coupon, and the first customer service agent said it was an issue on their end, that he'd credit half of my last order to my account in Uber Cash, and apply the coupon to my account. None of that ever happened. The second agent gave me a cookie cutter response saying the coupon expired in March 2023... also dead wrong. The coupon doesn't expire until the end of the month.

Too many items missing! 1 out of 4 times something is missing! This time it was the whole meal!!! The amount they refund does not reflect the amount you paid for missing items or maybe they are hitting me with a small order fee after the balance is reduced because either the restaurant or the driver forgot something. Am hungry and not happy right now! App constantly disregaurds replacement items and just gives me what they want.

However, some of the restaurants send customers food that is overcooked (Bojangles - 7000 block of South Blvd) or place the wrong items in the combo box. that you did not order.

"Uber eats has great deals most of the time. They are also pretty quick about getting a driver to pickup your order and deliver it to you. This is only if it is just your one order. If your Uber driver has 2 or more pickups where they have to wait a long amount of time after they've already picked up your food, then it makes your food cold and soggy depending on where you ordered from. This then makes the wait time entirely too long.","December 21, 2023",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Brandie Cook,Google Play Store
"The absolute WORST customer service experience I have ever had. They do not let you speak to a real person, just the live chats. Constantly transfer you, make you start the conversation from scratch, and then close it out before the issue is resolved or you can respond.

Highly DO NOT recommend","December 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,heather berboth,Google Play Store
They no longer refund you when items are missing from your order and only tell you that the order is ineligible for a refund. Their support team takes at least two weeks to even respond to the issue. I've had several orders now where the company has essentially stolen from me because they refuse to properly look into the issues. Support team is completely useless. An order arrived freezing cold and a week later all they said was that the items matched what I ordered. Disgusting.,"December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ariel Hope,Google Play Store
"Got a very poor food service from a uber eats restaurant, it was supposed to be a submelt but the paper came stuck on the bread, ordered as well some cheese bites which was from days ago or you could see the dryness. Requested a refund, and got previous refunds for much less hassle, and didn't get it! Very poor customer service overall from that experience.

Then after I placed the order, the coupon wasn't on there anymore for some reason and they charged me the full amount. So I canceled it. Without them even saying anything before cancelation, they charged me the full amount for the food as a cancelation fee.

"Misleading pricing practices, specifically they tack on extra charges to the restaurant that you don't see, so the actual restaurants have to raise the prices of their menu items about 30% over the normal menu price.

Might cost a little bit more but the monthly plan is really worth it for me. Any time a restaurant messes up I report it and it's usually refunded within the day.

My orders have gotten stolen multiple times before and constantly it'll change the latest delivery time. When you go to the help section it says deliveries arriving before the latest delivery time is considered on time but it will constantly change the latest time later and later so you have no way to get a refund on the food that doesn't get to your house.

Screenshot everything you do/every coupon that is advertised on your account (not that it'll necessarily help). Three times now I have tried to use a promo that was advertised when you open the app. Sometimes the promo will just randomly disappear and you won't be able to use it with your order. They'll ask you to provide a screenshot as proof. The last issue I had was unresolved and I think they just hope you'll forget about it after time.

I have been using Uber eats for a couple years now and have noticed things I like and don't like I don't like the fees to begin with If the company wasn't so greedy they would be paid more. I use Uber one to help with those fees and, in some cases, still can be $4 for ""taxes and fees"" on a $20 order. Also, at no fault to Uber, my order is missing or has something wrong with it 2/6 times roughly, and Uber eats kind of gives you a set amount they will pay.","January 9, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,David Pollard,Google Play Store

Shoppers often choose the wrong items, refuse to look for substitutes, or only offer absurd substitutes (vegan sausages substituted with all pork hot dogs, oat milk subbed with 3% cow milk).

Save your money, go get the food and save yourself 10-15 bucks. Priced it out, you'll pay 26-30% more, then pay ""service fees"" then delivery fees, then tips, which they shame you into.

"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves.

"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange!

"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store

Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Terrible. They replaced the Cornershop app by Uber, but it's way worse than it's predecessor. Just maybe 5 stores in my city versus so many available before on Cornershop. Less products available on the list (some that I used to bought 1-2x per week aren't there anymore). Can't find an option to ask a different product that was available on Cornershop. This transition was an unbelievable loss of functionality and usability. Looks like now it is easier to go the supermarket personally.","November 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eloir T S,Google Play Store
"There is no option to send feedback within the app so I have no choice but to complain here. My issue is regarding the service, not the app itself. I resent the fact that UE introduced the 'option' to pay for priority delivery, and now if you don't do it, your delivery takes at least an hour and arrives cold because the driver makes *multiple* stops en route.

"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store

They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour.

Still the customer care people made sure saying there is technical issues and we cannot do anything about it. I asked them to cancel the order and initiate refund as that's the policy, but customer care is like ""we don't see any of those options"".

An Easy to use app with a good selection of local restaurants to order from. The last two orders I have had problems with. The customer service was awful. On both occasions the compensation has been dreadful . The delivery drivers need to check they have the right order when making more than one delivery.

The menu for the exact same establishment is often different there than it is on Grubhub, especially restaurants that deliver cocktails.

They do offer refunds for missing items and surprisingly I havnt had many problems with the function.

An Issue I had recently was that I cancelled an order because it was taking too long, I noticed it was probably due to the cold weather that a lot of restaurants were closing early and it looked as though they were probably not preparing my order and no delivery driver was accepting my order. So I decided to cancel the order. Because I cancelled before my agent to wait 2 hours to cancel it for me I couldn't get a refund.

That cancelation was within 1 minute and even called the restaurant that they didn't start it yet. Uber then tells you to pay the food they didn't even do yet. What a Scam.","December 16, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Akina Mori,Google Play Store
"This app is fraudulent. I've been an Uber One member for almost a decade and items are missing every other order. When you try to request support, an automated message pops up that your order isn't eligible for refunds. When you text customer service, they copy and paste that same message. Use another food app. At least they won't take your money and not give the items you paid for.","December 22, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shamima Begum,Google Play Store
"Customer service is trash. They also charge a disgusting amount of fees. They mess up orders ALL the time and make you wait 6-12 hours for someone to contact you back for an error they made. Tried to do an add on order (which is supposed to be free delivery), got to the confirmation screen showing the amount I would be charged is $19.08, hit confirm and got charged $27.50 instead.

But two weeks ago I ordered groceries worth almost 70 euro and only got not even half of it. So I immediately took a picture and expected ubereat to refund me, deliver the missing items or give me a contact to the shop. What did I get?

"Garbage app, food prices go up every week. Won't honor their own deals they push to you either. So many double deliveries that food is cold more often than not, even with paying for the membership. They also like to charge you twice when you decide to be nice and increase your tip, than try to hold the extra money for more than a week.

After two months and dozens of messages sent to the support, they acknowledged this bug and won't do anything to fix it, neither will they reimburse the wrong, canceled order, initiated from their end.

They basically trick you with an offer to buy something else from another store to add to your current pending order for a free delivery, and then they switch your address to the wrong one which result In you spending extra and ending up not getting what you paid for.

"I have had Uber eats for a while now and the quality is there. The drivers deliver the food with cars and are efficient. The one thing though is that sometimes depending on the time and restaurants you order from, your order may have something added to it or something missing from it.

Haven't used this service in a while and just decided to open up the app and see what I could get and the prices are insane. Not only are they charging a ton of random fees that make no sense but they are also raising the price of the food items much higher than they cost at the restaurants.

Overall the app is pretty good at what it does. The one area of improvement I may suggest is making it easier to find vegan options across the various offerings. You are literally sitting on a pile of data you know what people are searching and what modifications and substitutions that they are making to make something vegan.

App itself has performance issues with it randomly restarting while trying to browse different stores or creating a cart. just a very suboptimal service and experience. and very overpriced for what you get in the end.","November 25, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Mujahid Hemani,Google Play Store
They have 0 customers support. They will charge you for the entire value of the meal even if you cancel 0.1 second after clicking complete the order by mistake. I put in the wrong address and realized legit 1 second after submitting. They didn't offer a cancellation. I had to pay for the whole thing even if I canceled. Getting in touch with support is imposible.,"November 4, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jay Freeman,Google Play Store
Thiefs. We order several items and only received a French fry and an empty box. This is not the first time that they make a mistake like this but it is the first time that they did not do anything about it. Terrible application freezes and crashes. Garbage application use door dash or skip the dishes or just deliver or pick up from the restaurant directly,"January 6, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nick flikas,Google Play Store
"The app is ANNOYING. I can't select which notifications to turn on or off, so either I don't get notifications while I have a delivery in progress, or I get bombarded with advertisements every day. Also, my address and delivery instructions are correct and clear, yet I've been getting notifications for about a year asking me to ""update my address"" or ""provide delivery instructions."" There's nothing to update and I HAVE provided instructions, yet it keeps asking! Customer support couldn't help.","December 28, 2023",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,k h,Google Play Store
"I started with them from the beginning. There have a lot of ups and downs with deliveries and the cost has risen. I still find it very convenient in NY based in parking, gas etc. So I do utilize the service often. Especially, when they offer 40% OFF Groceries/Pets. Also, restaurants have started providing Uber deals as well...nice. Customer Service treats me well and always refunds or five me Uber dollars when something is amiss.","January 2, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Theo Jack,Google Play Store
"Was given a $58 dollar quote at time of order than uber jacked the price up to $98 at delivery, without letting me know. Apaarently they offered a promotion at discount, removed the promo, then asked for me to prove I had a discount after I noticed the price change (customer support couldn't even provide a receipt). Word to wise, take screen shots, uber can change pricing and ask you to prove it.","December 15, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bryan Sheppard,Google Play Store
"Store gave me the wrong order and missing items I can't get help or a refund. Terrible service and app I will no longer be using after many years, I've seen a decline in the service and support recently, awful. Will be uninstalling. I'll probably have to get a charge back from my credit card company. Also got charged for an order that got cancelled. No proof for the order cancelled order which means I have to wait for uber eats to refund me.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google Sucks,Google Play Store
"I used to receive coupons, and the last ones that I would receive began to glitch and would randomly disappear from my account even though they didn't apply to my order and hadn't even expired yet. I contacted customer service and stated they would fix it. Ever since then I haven't any coupons at all for over a month at this point, I contacted customer service again about this matter and they don't care as they were dismissive and didn't help at all. I'm so disappointed!","December 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Leslie Sanchez,Google Play Store
"I have not experienced serious issues with the app, but one thing got me startled. I ordered from a 4.7 stars restaurant today (more than 200 ratings). The food was terrible and expensive. I tried to rate my order and the app did not allow me to do it. I checked google maps ratings for the place and voilÃ¡: 2.8 stars. So, I feel like I cannot trust ubereats ratings and this is supposed to be one of the most important features of this app. Couldn't rate differently: 1 star.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nossa Vida Pelo Mundo,Google Play Store
"After taking a long break, I came back and had great service (and used it a LOT) until the past month. Now twice in two weeks I had a driver cancel my order on their own accord. Both times were after the drivers were on their way, but they blamed it on the restaurant for various reasons. The customer service is ridiculous as well and service is the last thing they do. After being told I would get a $20 credit, they would give no more than $10, but when I checked and found only $.75. Liars!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Geoff Kratville,Google Play Store
