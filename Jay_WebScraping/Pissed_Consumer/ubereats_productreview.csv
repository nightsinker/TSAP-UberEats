"PLEASANT UNEXPECTED CUSTOMER SERVICEI gave Uber Eats a go after being totally fed up with poor service from the opposition. I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered a Chinese meal, mixed vegetables and singapore vegetarian noodles. My wife doesn't like prawns, so the veggie option should guarantee that. I also asked for them to be chili free The noodles had 3 prawns in them, and were a little too spicy. The veggies weren't as varied as I am used to, and a little underdone for my liking, so a little disappointing, the rest of the meal was perfectly fine, and I ate my wifes noodl...

UberEats or shall be known as UberEats Money is the best delivery service I have ever seen!!!UberEats have been delivering our orders on time time !

"Delivery delaysWe were provided with a final time for the delivery when the order was picked up but ended up with the time getting longer and longer as the driver took another order and delivered it before ours. The time it took the driver to deliver to deliver the first order and drive to us was the difference between our original delivery time and the actual delivery time. I expect some slight reasonable change in time but not this amountShow details

"Best app in melbourne for deliveriesmenu log is the worst of the worst, deliveroo is alright, but uber eats has been the best for me in melbourne!! always timely, customer service response is fast aswell as refund action. I use uber eats atleast once a week and they have never screwed my order the last two years being here. I think most drivers that are signed with uber eats are probably payed and treated better than the drivers for menu log or deliveroo. because holy fck i can not get over how bad menu log is guys. literally never been so enraged from crappy service, refunding, and wait time of 3+ hoursShow details",2022-12-16T10:13:43.000Z,5,Leanne,productreview,Best app in melbourne for deliveries

"My Rating as a Uber Eats Delivery DriverNothing but praise to Uber Eats since commencing with them in January 2022. I gain personal satisfaction through my interactions with both customers and merchants. The Uber Eats App is excellent and easy to use from the perspective of a delivery person. Well designed and constructive in all aspects including a functional and highly effective GPS Navigation System. In my opinion Uber is far superior when compared to Menulog, Deliveroo and Doordash. Many opportunities exist to earn good money with Uber Eats, in particular, using the Boost system and regular Promotions. I encourage all persons no matter there age to join Uber Eats as a delivery partner. Uber is well deserving of a 5 Star Rating.Show details",2022-04-27T22:51:33.000Z,5,scorpio88,productreview,My Rating as a Uber Eats Delivery Driver
"better than menulogUber Eats is very good in terms of their refund service and policy, i have found that they are much better than Menulog which is by the way the worst service ever.
Only once i have been told an order has been delivered but was never actually delivered, i immediately received a refund, when this occurred on Menulog i was interrogated and never got my money back.
Uber Eats app is smooth and shows you the name of the driver and what vehicle they're in, and there is also a cool tracker.Show details

"Uber Eats now usable in the Dandenong RangesUber Eats used to be great - prompt delivery, no troubles at all. In the past six months though, it's become unusable in the Dandenong Ranges; my last few orders have been cancelled some time *after* they were due to be delivered, presumably because there were no drivers available. I've entirely stopped using them, because I have a young family to feed, so I need reliable service.Show details",2022-02-21T11:35:57.000Z,5,Duncan Bayne,productreview,Uber Eats now usable in the Dandenong Ranges

"UberEats driver experienceI have delivered to almost 500 people across Perth and I have never come across to a rude or unsatisfied customer. But, I can tell you this much from my experience to help you (customer) and us (delivery drivers):

2. Make sure your phone is charged and on you
3. Make sure your delivery address is correct
4. Give notes to help delivery drivers to find you

As a preface, I use food delivery services frequently when I am in China and South Korea where it is common, cheap and fast. In a country like Australia however, where services like this are only just starting up and residences/local businesses are at a much lower density, I have always scaled down my expectations appropriately.

"Reasonable Food Choice; Reasonable Delivery FeeSince COVID I've used Uber Eats a number of times to deliver meals. Overall, I've been quite happy with the service and my observations are:
1. Restaurant choice is good without being excessive. I've found there is a distance limit that can appear to be arbitrary. For example, I can order from Civic to my house, a distance of 6-7 kms; but not Woden which is 8 kms and still within what I consider a reasonable distance;
2. The drivers have been courteous and place the food outside. They also ring the doorbell; and
3. If you choose priority for a few dollars more, then your food is delivered as promptly as picking it up yourself.
I've had one or two items missed from the order early on, but this was rectified by the restaurant. Overall, I've been happy with the service and have used it several dozen times in the last six months. For the Canberra area, Uber Eats is a good service provided your restaurant is close by, you know what you are getting, and tick the important 'priority' box. I also tip, which goes to the driver, and that may help as well. The only thing that stops it getting five stars is the somewhat arbitrary distance limitation that seems determined by a compass rather than driving times. But definitely recommended.

First, ubereats doesn't offer all the options that your selected restaurant actually has, Second, the prices are higher than what they actual restaurants offer. For instance, Bondi burgers from Oporto is $10 but it is $11 in ubereats. Ubereats charges you for delivery so they shouldn't charge you more for the actual food. The third issue is the GST, they add GST on top of all extras, more expra price for your foid and delivery. So it starts adding up.

Some good vegan options on there considering it's only been up for a few months (though I'd appreciate even more vegan options, UberEats!)
It's true that the food wasn't piping hot all three times, but it was plenty warm for me.

To make it worse, I tried to contact them a couple of times and noticed their chat was disconnected too.
It is deceiving knowing that you have to make sure no item has been removed otherwise you lose the discount just like me. There is no proof if they did it on purpose during the order preparation which means you have to pay attention to your order in case they pull this one on you.

"Packaging safety issueI sufffer from a condition where I don’t have any nerves/sensation/feeling in my feet.
The UBER delivery bags often are sealed with staples - on more than one occasion, a staple has fallen loose onto the floor. Some vendors & delivery services use sticky advertising tape - which can’t kill me !
Of course it’s a long shot, but if I don’t see a tiny piece of wire or staple on the floor, and it goes *inside* my skin, it can migrate into my bloodstream… you know the rest.

We were getting regular updates, payment was received and accepted etc, and then at the last minute, about an hour after we made the order we get a notification to say our order has been cancelled. Literally after we’d waited over an hour for our food and thought everything was going fine. So, with no explanation we called...

Can't contact Ubereats!!Our Ubereats order that was delivered was completely wrong!! Obviously got someone elses order. I tried to find a number for Ubereats to get this fixed and after searching the app for ages finally found a number that kept disconnecting after a few rings. On the app they have a section to give feedback on a wrong order - but why would I just write something when I've wasted $45 on food I can't eat and want it rectified immediately?? Why do they make it so hard to contact them in a situation such as this? Last order we made we had to wait over an hour for a restaurant that was 15 mins away.

"UberEats - We're not stupid. We know you're scamming usThere's no way one is able to have a discussion with UberEats, so unfortunately all grievances are, out of necessity, aired publicly.
I've been using UberEats to purchase groceries from my local Spudshed in Bentley, Western Australia. I've noticed that after putting items in my cart the prices, at times, inexplicably rise by 10-20%. Really, UberEats!? Is it not enough that you put a hefty margin on the items plus charge service fees? Is it really necessary to have an algorithm that raises the prices at random once one has selected items? How d...

"Scam companyI accidentally placed an order on the app (no notice to confirm purchase), I immediately called the business to tell them the mistake. They cancelled my order and soon after I received an email from Uber Eats saying because I didn’t cancel in less than 5 minutes (which I did) I would be charged the total amount regardless as a cancellation fee. There is no phone contact for customer service to work out this problem. This is insane. Can’t believe they are allowed to operate in this way",2024-01-09T03:33:34.000Z,1,Kristy,productreview,Scam company
Poor delivery servicePaid for Priority with Zamberro which stated 6.55pm delivery. Tracked Uber Driver who accepted order but went to Tullebudgerra 1st. Did not pick up our order until after 7.7.05pm. Meal was stone cold & inedible when it arrived at 7.15pm. Believe it had been sitting at Zamberros for some time.,2024-01-08T23:21:35.000Z,1,Lyn Wicks,productreview,Poor delivery service

"Too many dishonest Ethnic driversI live less than 200M from a shopping centre that has McDonald's, Hungry Jacks, Chicken Treat etc. My schedule is very tight & I'm a father of young kids with special needs so uber eats is often an easy choice. Living so close, I know when they're busy & when they're not so when the uber app shows the driver sitting there for 40 mims while my estimated delivery time keeps changing, I call the restaurant only to find out that they've had to remake my order twice because it sat so long.

"Not same drivers as picturesIn Merrylands it happened alot and again today, the picture of the delivery person didn't match the person delivering it.
They also are lazy when they go to Coles, alot of the times they say things are out of stock because they can't be bothered asking the staff where the item is. I use it alot but the service is bad even if yiur a good customer, they've had picked yo .y order before making y times but stayed in the restaurant for another 30mins, so my food is ruined before they left the restaurant, thry were probably stucking arounf to lick up another dozen orders wwhich probaly all went bad.It also expensive.

"Drivers & company are scammers!!!Recently every driver that picks up my order has a rating of around 80% and today my driver had a 71% RATING. HOW IS THAT ALLOWED. Today it took 3 different drivers to get my ONE order.

"Delivering for UberEatsI have worked as a contracted UberEats delivery partner. At the beginning the pay rate was fairly good and could even make a living doing it Full time. In the last 3 years, they have literally reduced rates, taken away surges, No incentive's and the Quests they give is shockingly bad!. Their even paying $5 to $6 for double jobs. This company has turned into a Slave income market. They want you to use your own car, fuel, insurance etc and pay as little as possible.",2023-12-30T04:07:10.000Z,1,Fabrice L,productreview,Delivering for UberEats
