"My spouse accidentally placed an order on the Uber Eats app and I tried to cancel it immediately. Since there is no option to cancel the order on the app, I had to start the chat with Uber agents. After a few minutes, an agent was connected and they told me since the store has already started preparing the order, the cancellation fee is equal to the totoal amount of the order (243.08$, order# **, date 01/22/2024 at 12:28 pm).

I ordered with my wrong address. I then changed it to my current address and it cancelled my order. They didn't give a refund and it was quite expensive. Why? Stupid policy that makes no sense. Fix your site.,le,"Zionsville, IN",1,"January 20, 2024",Consumer Affairs
I came upon a promotion on Uber Eats to purchase grocery $70+ and get 50% discount. I placed an order and the promotion was applied to my order at checkout. I get the product delivered and I see I was charged full amount. I go online to check the promotion and it is gone. I reach out to customer service via chat and I was told if I cannot produce a picture of the promotion that nothing can be done. A promotion that Uber eats put in app and I am been told if I cannot produce a picture of the promotion I will not get help. How fraudulent a company can you be. You put a promotion and you are asking me for a picture of the promotion you put up yourself. UBER EATS YOU ARE THIEVES!!!,Ijeoma,"Winnipeg, MB",1,"January 19, 2024",Consumer Affairs
"Uber Eats. Ok. I am actually tired of all the wrong orders being received. As the issue should be with the individual merchant this complaint against Uber Eats is because they penalize customers when merchants gets something wrong. To elaborate, recently, Jan 6, 2024 order placed and one item was not received, but rather a completely different item. A picture was taken and sent to UE. 1- Not only did they NOT respond within the 48 hrs but instead, 13 days later!, they said the food was picked up and no refund will be given. First, 13 days later is unacceptable. Second, the order was NEVER picked up. It was delivered. Third, how dare you penalize the customer and let the merchant just get away with getting the order wrong. This is wrong and flat out an unacceptable business model.

"I make many orders from Uber EATS, but in the past few months, when I am missing an item in my order, they are not getting back to me, or it takes weeks to hear something back from their customer service support team in the app. Postmates was the app I used to use. They bought the company. An order was made on January 6, 2024, and they returned to me on January 19, 2024, at 7:00 AM. I ordered with Subway, and one of my items was not delivered. After I didn’t hear back from Uber EATS in two hours, I contacted the store, and they said they ran out of oatmeal cookies and I needed to contact Uber EATS for a refund. The store should’ve got me and given me another option or cancel the order, but they didn’t. More",Timmy,"Miami, FL",1,"January 19, 2024",Consumer Affairs
"I placed an order today for groceries to be delivered from Uber Eats. My groceries came and I always expect a wrong item to be accidentally picked up or something a little different than what I would have picked for myself. I figure it's the give and take from getting my groceries delivered for me. However, when I looked at the receipt the driver gave me versus the receipt that Uber Eats charged me, there was a very significant difference. Uber Eats charged me WAY more for the grocery items than what the cost of the items from the store actually were. I compared line by line and most items I was overcharged.

This company took 60.00 of money out my kids' mouth cause I cancelled my order. This company told me I wasn't able to get my money refunded to feed my kids.

"I will NEVER EVER EVER order from Uber Eats EVER again.. Normally I only ever order from DoorDash which is already bad enough but at least they refund me when they mess up! My first time ordering off Uber Eats in a long time today & my food came super cold. I contacted support & they refused to give me a refund for the roll. This is RIDICULOUS. This is how y’all run a business? Yeah no wonder y’all are desperate for money. & y’all are gonna keep being desperate for money until y’all go out of business completely (: because that’s what happens when you treat paying customers like this.

"1 star because I have to leave one. I placed two orders on 01/13/2024. One for my father and one for myself. The delivery took forever to come and when it did, I sent my daughter to retrieve the meals. She only came back inside with one and that meal wasn’t mine nor my father’s. I only ordered the second meal because we were hungry and already waited a long time for this order to arrive and I know it was the driver's fault. Customer support is no help and they hung up on me. They kept sending automated messages saying I couldn’t be refunded. So, they’re making me pay for meals from the first order that I never received (the incorrect order received was thrown away), but wanna thank me for being a member for 9 years. I’ll never use this again and I’m deleting all my family members accounts as well!",Dani,"Tampa, FL",1,"January 17, 2024",Consumer Affairs
I guess Uber Eats isn’t making enough money. They told me that my order had been canceled so I resubmitted it. I ended up with two identical orders that came at once. It was cold out so I tipped $4 - he took 8. I reported the cancellation problem right away and they said tough and refused the refund even though I was in the 48 hour period. They were also rude. I’ve used the normal Uber since they started but am canceling my account. Imagine my surprise when I looked at reviews and saw they had done the exact same things to others.

"Ordered Chili's restaurant through Uber Eats. The 1st chilis I ordered from Glitch in their system because I was directed to a Chilis 10 miles away where as I’ve always order from the chilis near my house (2 miles away). Did not realize it was the wrong chilis until I looked at the tracking, called uber eats to tell them it was the wrong one and had to wait 1-1/2 hour. Thinking they were really busy, I told them my food would be cold and soggy when I get it, they said to call back if the food was cold and soggy which I did, I was told I would not get a refund whatsoever, even though this was completely their fault and the customer service girl acknowledged it was their fault.

I called the store and he did not deliver them to the store that he said he did. I called Uber back, no answer.

"UberEats itself is a wonderful concept and great app, but their customer service is seriously lacking. I have placed several orders where several items have been missing, and when I call Uber Eats to report the missing food, the only response I have gotten was that I would be refunded for the items. That's great and all, but what do I do with the people who have nothing to eat because they didn't receive their order???

I tried to explain this to customer service when I “report an issue” but nothing is ever done about it. The last time the service rep couldn’t seem to grasp what I was trying to explain to him and closed out the chat on me. Of course I was frustrated during the conversation but I made sure to not appear to be lashing out at him because I know it’s not his fault personally.

I didn't receive my delivery order even though I was communicating with the delivery driver. She still delivered my order to wrong address. So I called customer service for a refund which they refunded immediately which was good. But then they informed me that they could not refund the tip I gave to the driver. I replied that I want my refund in full including the Tip I gave. Customer service replied that they could not refund the Tip because that went straight to the driver. I replied the driver does not deserve the Tip due her not delivering my food. They said they can't do anything about that but they would give me Uber Eats credit. I denied and requested a full refund. They refused. That's the reason ubereats is not worth the hassle. Poor customer service and a ripoff. Use favor or someone else.

I noticed however Uber Eats has severely gone downhill as far as their customer experience. As much as I appreciate getting a refund for an incorrect order/wrong missing items/wrong delivery location, simply refunding the order is sometimes just a band-aid to shut the customer up and not get to the root of the problem.

I started watching him through my Ring camera. The driver exited his car and walked to the back driver's side door, quickly closing it.

Uber Eats is a fraudulent company. They offer promo codes directly in your account that DO NOT WORK. It's a scam to get you to purchase them. They bill you the full amount later. There is no promo.

Told me once they could not reach the driver. Another time the driver took the food back and when I reordered it brought me back the same cold food. Awful service.

They will give 4 tries and if you don't accept they will log you off automatically as it will say on the screen ""Are you still there, it seems you missed a lot of deliveries, will log you off and come back online again when you're ready"" which is absolutely ridiculous because they are forcing you to accept a 3.50 for an 8 mi delivery....

"I had a promotion for free Uber One for 4 months to get free delivery. Then at the same time they had promotions going on for a month for buy on get one free at some restaurants, and then they had: spend $25 save 40% up to the first $15. So, I was looking forward to buying a lot for a few months to try it out. I placed an order at Harold's Chicken Shack, and there was a delivery charge of $5.50. Any delivery over $5 is not free with Uber one. Then I saw that there was another location of Harold's Chicken Shack, and this had free delivery, I think, it didn't say if there was a charge for delivery. I had just placed the order and I thought I could cancel and reorder from the other location. I tried to find where to cancel and I clicked on a link that led to a chat with a robot. A lot of text was spewed so fast I couldn't read, then I clicked on Cancel Order, then it said I was just charged $18.50. More",Brian,"Chicago, IL",1,"February 2, 2023",Consumer Affairs
"Uber Eats has to be one of the worst companies on the face of the Earth. What a scam! We ordered two burrito bowls tonight from chipotle and got charge $67.88. When I called into them to question it, they said that they charged an $18 service fee Plus a delivery fee plus the tip on top of the $30 order. I had absolutely no idea well making the order that it was going to be more than $33 but my bank notified me of the $67.$.88. We will never use this Gammy company again and I want to make sure people know that they can really get screwed over by Uber eats. We are retired and on a limited income, and I thought it would be nice on my birthday to order in having no idea that this company would do this to us.

"Besides Uber blocking my debit and credit card once I got to Mexico and even then I had horrific experiences trying to get someone who either spoke English or actually wrote something other than a generic response, in May I ordered a pizza. The driver never came to the door & I got charged for a pizza I never got. I have to pay cash because of them blocking my US credit cards and they are an AMERICAN COMPANY, so there was no way to refute the charge via the app! Since May I have wasted tons of my time trying to get someone who has a brain to respond to my messages either on the app or in email & remove the charge. I even had 2 other people try with no luck and then I got my VA to try & she also had the same issues as me, so I had to pay someone to get nowhere.

"THIS COMPANY TREATS ITS DRIVERS TERRIBLY, DON'T WORK FOR THEM. Let me start by saying that ordering food from this company is a rip off, for the customer and the driver. The average pay per trip as a driver for Uber Eats is $2 no matter the distance, so any real money is made through tips. Their system will also miscalculate trip earnings and give you trips where the restaurants are closed or the restaurant can't make the food, be careful if you cancel trips too many times. It's YOUR FAULT, whether you call to verify a closed restaurant or not. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. More",Jordan,"Las Vegas, NV",1,"January 12, 2023",Consumer Affairs

Uber canceled my order because there were no drivers in the area, they said (their map said there was). I guess that's understandable. What showed no respect for me was that NOBODY TOLD ME! I was left waiting and waiting. I finally called the restaurant and they said my food had been sitting there for almost an hour, and that Uber canceled it 30 minutes ago. Why wouldn't the App at least tell me that? So I unhooked my trailer, risked leaving my load unattended, and drove my tractor into town to pick up my now-cold meal.

You can't call and talk to a human being. I have sent like 20 text and emails to them to try to get a refund and have not gotten one. It looks like I'm going to have to cancel my bank account and open a new one so they stop taking money out. They will steal from you.,Amy,"Peoria, IL",1,"January 8, 2022",Consumer Affairs
"My suggestion, use DoorDash or Grubhub. Uber Eats is not worth the trouble and aggravation when they deliver the wrong food, or the order is incomplete or it shows up late and cold. They are not worth the trouble to call and wait 15 or 20 minutes to get a rep on the phone to say, ""I’ll refund the order but you have to reorder it if you want it."" Plus giving you a coupon for $5.00 off your next purchase. They are not worth the trouble when there is other competition out there that is doing it better than Uber Eats. So my suggestion is use another company.",Andrew,"Kissimmee, FL",1,"January 8, 2022",Consumer Affairs

"I have ordered a lot from Uber eats but recently they have changed their policies that is anti customer service. First let me let you know my last to delivers took 1 hour and 45 minutes. I worked for Pizzahut in college and we prided ourselves to get delivery to you in thirty min but if it was a hour we would discount your food. I find all the deliver service are take over a hour. Second, uber is now charging a extra fee if they don't have enough driver. So now you pay more to get cold food. I am surprised know gas called the health department. I know the temp we are getting our food at are below safety standards, Uber likes to charge a additional fee to be prioritized which cause more of a issue with getting your food on time. I worked for pizzahut for many years and we never charged these outrageous service fees and what's more amazing the delivery apps are double dipping charging the restaurant and the customer and expect tips over the top.",James,"New Market, MD",1,"January 1, 2022",Consumer Affairs

And any time I’ve turned to Uber Eats for support, they just conveniently aren’t available. This time I paid for items I didn’t even receive because “no refund is available.” I tried to connect to the delivery driver and he simply didn’t pick up.

"This is the worst customer support I have ever dealt with. I have guys working out of town and do not have transportation to go get food so I have them use Uber Eats business but that was a huge mistake. To start off with they delivered the food to wrong address when there was very specific directions I left for them. Took me over an hour to get in contact with someone and then when I finally did they would not help my guys get any food, said they would refund but that’s it. Now keep in mind this is after 9 pm, they are starving working in the freezing cold all day. So they get no help from customer support, tell them to order again so they did and 20 minutes after ordering again this is after 11, get email saying they can’t deliver food, try again somewhere else and customer service still won’t help.

The reason that the missing items point is the worst point is that you are literally just not compensated in any form for them not being provided.

Uber Eats does not care about its customer. Drivers do not check orders to ensure what they are picking up matches what was ordered.

She stated she will refund me $18.80 but what she also did was double charge me $18.80 because my card had an overdraft of $37. When I called the bank they told me that at 11:49 today I was double charged. When I reached out to them they kept telling me that they were refunding me the $18.80. But they weren’t listening to me as I told them they charged me twice for the same food.

He became very confrontational, threatening, harassing and provoking towards me, I think because I yelled at him from across the street to bring me my order. I was frightened & very confused why he was acting in this manner. He was a minority individual and untruthfully accused me of discrimination, prejudice and judgmental of his colour and Muslim faith.

I planned to use the coupon for dinner when my family would be home. So we can all enjoy a take out meal. Well, I put the code in the app, and my receipt showed the full amount. The code coupon didn’t go through. I called the restaurant, they said call UberEats. I called UberEats and they said they don’t handle coupon codes and that I have to go through the app. What a nightmare. More",Tarsha,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,"November 3, 2020",Consumer Affairs
"My experience is similar to others who reviewed them. I also kept receiving emails about a $30 credit for first time use. So I decided to try. The discount never came up and then I emailed them and they said it wasn't valid. Really? Well I ordered anyway (the fees are really high) but we didn't have time to cook. I received multiple texts confirming the delivery date and time. When it was 15 minutes after the delivery was supposed to arrive, I called the restaurant and they said the order was still sitting there. The restaurant said that they don't call Uber Eats when that happens but the customer had to. There is no phone number!!! More",Jill,"Bethesda, MD",1,"November 1, 2020",Consumer Affairs
"They emailed me a promo code for $30 off a first order. After trying multiple times with it not working, I eventually figured out (after an exhaustive search) how to message them through Twitter. After a back & forth of several messages they claimed that the code couldn’t be used because of fraud. They gave zero explanation. When I further questioned it, they claimed that I had a second account and that multiple accounts violated their terms of service. This was literally the one and only time I have ever created an account with them. When I questioned it more, they wouldn’t give me any answers. I asked them to show me proof of the other account and they didn’t acknowledge that. The following is my last message to them as of the time of this review. I’m still waiting...

I placed an order on 10/10 that totaled $42.36 however my Paypal account was charged 73.92 which I can confirm cleared my bank. Then my order was cancelled and I have yet to be refunded. Uber Eats says I wasn't charged but I accounts say otherwise.,Angela,"Chester, VA",1,"October 21, 2020",Consumer Affairs
