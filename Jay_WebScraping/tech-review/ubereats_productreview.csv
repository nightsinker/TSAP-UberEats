"I'd like the convenience, but too many of the drivers are non-english speaking and the instructions to my community show the wrong entrance gate, so it is difficult to correct the driving instructions when communicating with them. The application does not give you the option of correcting. I have left notes in the app, but evidently no one reads them.","January 28, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,William Brookfield,Google Play Store
"Lately it's very common to wait over 2 hours for the food, while the order is passed on to 3 or 4 drivers before one finally cancels. What in the world is wrong with this app? If more than one driver passes on, it should auto cancel. Otherwise I'm waiting for food that I'm not sure if it will arrive, and then it never does. Literally not rendering the service. Happens constantly. HUGE problem. System needs a change.","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bastian H,Google Play Store
"THEY STEAL FROM YOU! I placed an order a while back and it was wrong. They were going to refund me, which never happened. On top of that, they took more money from me on tips when I didn't authorise it. I gave a $10 tip and instead they took $20, plus the original $10 plus another $7. Their customer service doesn't do anything besides give me the same automated message. Horrible service, my issue was never resolved so I cancelled my uber one. Do not recommend.","January 28, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,M Z.,Google Play Store
"The app works great. One thing I wish is that they would allow us to change the delivery address after an order is placed in the case that we made an error. Other than that, great app. It loads fast, the UI is responsive and intuitive. Great selection of restaurants. Great job from the mobile team at Uber.","January 26, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,paterson deshommes,Google Play Store
"Edit: they brought the feature back! Used to be amazing, but they just got rid of their best feature, the ability to search for dishes. You used to be able to search for a specific dish and find everyone who makes that dish and delivers to you and how much they charge. Now it's just a mediocre delivery app... why would you get rid of this feature???","January 18, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Rufus Wright,Google Play Store
"I loved the new feature where you get 10 seconds to review your order after placing it. Really ""Looks good"". Everything seems perfect tech wise. There is one problem/situation where I have already waited a long time for my order and the order gets cancelled by the driver or the restaurant after accepting it. That's really disappointing. Overall everything's great. P.S Keep the discounts and promotions coming.","January 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tatva Shah,Google Play Store
Fairly easy to use but trying to find out what is happening with order or contacting someone is terrible. Drivers also seem to be rarely checked out by uber (different person turns up to who is registered) so security/safety issues. Some of the drivers are also pretty rubbish and constantly cancel once they accept leaving you waiting for ages for another delivery person and food then turns up cold.,"January 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,broomee c,Google Play Store
"Finally was tempted to try Uber eats instead of my usual delivery app due to the $25 discount. All I can say is definitely not worth it at zero price. After an hour and a half of waiting I canceled the order. Most of you would probably say that's not Uber's problem, but the thing is the delivery driver showed picking up the delivery nearly 45 minutes into the order and then just sat at the restaurant. It just kept showing that they're on their way. Very disappointing, probably won't try again.","January 27, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Anthony Cox,Google Play Store
"I order on here every month and not a SINGLE time people have got my order completely correct, either it was food order or grocery or from convenience stores. When I have asked to make adjustments, now they are saying they adjusted a lot so they won't. The amount of stress from ordering in app and making it right is far more than my effort to go to the store to get the correct items at a much cheaper price at this point. I'm done with paying high fees to get wrong items and getting blamed.","January 28, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sophia Xiong,Google Play Store
"Very disappointed in this app. I've used it for a long time but the service fees keep increasing, sometimes up to $20 extra for a small 10 items order. Also, as I'm adding to my cart for promotions, the promotion disappears. Lastly, the prices for items are often higher than in store. Overall, it costs almost twice as much at times.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Kristi B,Google Play Store
"Ordered the food(Karlsruhe Ubereats), delivered to wrong address, and said they kept the food and went. We went to the address they mentioned and checked, NO FOOD! Contacted the customer service, and they refused to refund the order. Even didn't take into consideration that they delivered it to a different address, which was a very evident mistake. Very bad customer service.","January 26, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rufa Rafeek,Google Play Store
"When the customer service is automated, this app is fine. Horrible, terrible customer service if you actually need to speak to a human being. They seem to be scripted and unable to deviate from the script at all. It is maddening, like talking to an AI that can't remember what it said in the previous chat bubble. Not to mention the prices skyrocketing from menu prices, sometimes at a mark up of up to 50%, your food will always be either cold or poorly packaged and damaged. Just go out instead.","January 27, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jason L,Google Play Store
"Every order I have placed has been 30+ mins late. The drivers accept multiple orders at the same time which causes yours to be late. The last order I placed was going to take OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF to get to me because the ""driver"" was on foot? There is virtually no support, and even if you cancel an order before a driver was assigned, there's no getting your tip back. Terrible experience. Would give zero stars if I could.","January 27, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Allie E,Google Play Store
"Usually works well, we use it often. We once had an issue with the order and it was handled without us even contacting support. I would appreciate a wider selection of healthy food. The prime delivery feature is pointless. Promised us a delivery in 15 mins, but we waited for 40 which was longer than standard. I would also suggest a feature of being able to modify the address after placing the order and before the courier picking it up. Currently you lose all your money upon changing the address.","January 19, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Evelin Koppel,Google Play Store
"This application is becoming unbearable, instead of progressing, it's only becoming worse. Rating orders when you need to is almost impossible. I keep getting notifications to rate my last order and lead nowhere just to the main landing page. Most importantly, im so sick of this horrible algorithm of recommending restaurants. After years of being a loyal customer, it still doesn't get what I like and don't! Too expensive for absolutely no reason.","January 17, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ishak Al Khatib,Google Play Store
"Ignoring the astronomical ""taxes and fees"", I was forced to update the app and now every time I click on anything, there's a consistent pop up asking me to turn on notifications. On. Every. Single. Page. Also, hitting back no matter what page I'm on takes me back to the homepage instead of the previous page I was on. Extremely annoying and makes me not want to use the app.","January 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steph V,Google Play Store
"Ive had an absolutely horrible experience with this app from drivers taking over 2 hours to money being withdrawn from my account and then my order ""magically"" disappearing from my account and having to contact my bank to fix it. To top it all off trying to find a way to contact customer support is IMPOSSIBLE and you can't even find a number to call anywhere. Don't bother, use any other service. This app sucks. If I could give zero stars I would.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charmaine N,Google Play Store
"I'd give it a zero if I could. The food itself is usually fine, but that's the restaurant's doing. Uber's service is TERRIBLE. We have tried them repeatedly for delivery, but consistently have issues - wrong order, missing items, left at the wrong house, left at the door without knocking and it got cold, etc. The ""resolution"" has always been ""try again another time"". There's no line to call for help, and chat will just cut the conversation off if you don't agree to their ""resolution"".","January 14, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lindsey Miller,Google Play Store
"Horrible I had an uber 1, trial & when it came time to cancel. I found out that to do so through the app , and unless you work for them, there is not someone. w/o fileing a support ticket. so that clearly tells you , not that it could take forever to get a response, but they don't, tell you there is still no one to talk to. And that was days after the trial period was over and was expected to pay for the subscription, I never used the benefits of the subscription 1 single time.","January 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,james Linge,Google Play Store
"Everything run smooths for the most part until your order is cancelled for something that goes awry with the restaurant. That's when Uber sends you a nice e-mail saying ""you were charged anyways"", and when you seek support for it, directs you to a page about why they're allowed to take the whole chunk of change (even though it was a restaurant deliveryperson). Sorry customer support, this company isn't salvageable.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nippy fish,Google Play Store
"I won't be using it again. Every single item is actually more expensive than advertised at the restaurant. Only at the end did i know i got charged a service fee and delivery fee. I chose priority service, but even that was a disaster because the delivery person went the wrong way and had to meet half way just to save time (as the food was getting cold). To top it off 1 meal was missing. In the end I had to go myself to order the food. If you want something done right you better do it yourself.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gregory,Google Play Store
"If a restaurant failed to deliver part of an order, they would send out the missing item. UberEats just refunds you (the cost of the item, not the percentage they took) but leaves you with only half of your dinner, and no way to do anything about it - you can't even give the place the bad rating it deserves. It's not good enough. People don't spend extra money for restaurant food to have their meal and evening ruined. Uber should deliver the missing item and charge the restaurant for redelivery.","January 9, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,V W,Google Play Store
"Placed big order for lunch, charged $51 for it. Order disappeared entirely. No confirmation emails or anything. Doesn't show in order history. No way to contact support via the app, because it makes me select an order first (which doesn't exist). I'm out of pocket $51 and I don't know how to get it back. It's not a temporary hold in my bank account, the money is already deducted. Terrible experience. Can't order again because my bank balance is too low now.","January 26, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Chris Rossi,Google Play Store
"There was a brief window of time when this was a 5 star app. I was paying $9.99 a month for Uber One, but Uber canceled my membership without informing me. I did rejoin, but I'm considering just being done with it. The app is borderline inoperable right now. It slows down, closes, crashes, and reloads constantly while I'm trying to order. I updated it, but that actually made the issue even worse. This is by far the most expensive delivery app out there, which means they have the money to fix it.","January 2, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,T O,Google Play Store
"Does not safeguard delivery person effort and tip. Often, an app bug prevents me from leaving a tip or causes the tip to appear twice. The Uber representatives respond ""can not help."" It is a deliberate product design flaw, where they make it impossible to fix any issue with tipping, even when caused by Uber service itself! Guys....be professional and own your issues. Fix this inhumane product design choice asap, try to improve your reputation for once. Backup plan: give us default tip setting","January 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Marco Facchini,Google Play Store
"Uber eats has become the most pointless app ever, there is almost no upside to it anymore. 1. Where the prices used to be reasonable they no have massive markups 2. Where the delivery was quick and efficient, it has now become incredibly slow. 3. Where there used to be amazing specials that allowed it to be affordable , it's no longer there. If you like waiting 40 minutes fpr food that you pay 20% more for, is cold, that you pain stakingly give instructions to get there. Here's your app","January 21, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Alistair Mckay,Google Play Store
"Disappointed. Order cancelled by the system/driver 2 minutes before estimated delivery? Thanks for nothing? The grocery system also seems useless. There's zero inventory management so until the shopper arrives at the store, no idea if something is sold out or not, or what condition it may be in. Not the person's fault, but the app is misleading in many ways. This app seems to be trying to scam you. Offers and promotions disappear constantly or are hidden away as much as possible.","January 21, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Aaron Loh,Google Play Store
"I placed a takeaway order on UberEats and the status page showed that I can add items from grocery stores for no delivery fee. I decided to give that a go and added some items from Co-Op. When the order got charged, I noticed that they added almost £7 in various fees, which is totally not what was agreed to! Their support in app doesn't have any option for dealing with this nor does it let you speak to a human, so I reached out to them on Facebook, but they were unhelpful.","January 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Vlad Schnakovszki,Google Play Store
Ordered from 1 place and was trying to order a second item from another place but it wouldn't let me place it on the same order. Ended up ordering separate so I canceled the second order to correct it. But apparently wasn't quick enough to cancel so they still charged me for the canceled order. I ended up re ordering so it was same driver delivery. Got charged for the same item they brought me twice. Talked to customer service they just said they won't do anything hope I understand. Poor servic,"January 28, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,M O,Google Play Store
"Love it. Great offers. Good selections. Food and shopping arrive at your door. The drivers are professional and courteous. No complaints on the services offered. Any time an order is wrong, customer service refunds, this doesn't happen frequently, but it can occur. It gets put right, right away. I am happy to use this App, it provides me with heaps of choices I wouldn't normally explore. Thank you","January 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Andrew Higgs,Google Play Store
"Normally my experience with the app isn't bad (aside from the huge hike in ""fees"" they charge that don't even go to the drivers btw). But when the app gave me an option to replace an option that one of my favorite restaurants didn't have, not only did the app not update my order properly, it got rid of my promo. That charged me well over the price I intended to pay. I can only imagine how many other people were charged extra for this ""glitch"". Fix your app and your ""fees.""","January 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,T H,Google Play Store
"This company will scam you in any way possible. I had two promotions applied to my order before I placed it, and neither one applied after I paid. They charged me full price. I called customer service, which was a a joke, and they told me I didn't understand the BOGO offer that had been applied. I told them the offer said nothing about the two items being identical and the system literally applied it for me before I hit ""place order"". The total showed with the discount. Then I was charged more.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Angela Bierbaum,Google Play Store
"Mysterious disappearing promotions. Looks like a promotion, you click on it and it disappears, or your order gets rejected and the promotion disappears. Customer services are obsessed with screenshots of disappeared promotions because they clearly don't understand the concept of disappeared... Used to function and offer good promotions, now not worth it.","January 19, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,N H,Google Play Store
"Extremely inconsistent. Every time you order using the app you get a different experience sometimes you can add items from another store, sometimes not. Sometimes you can change or cancel an order within 10 seconds of placing it, other times once you place it it's locked in no matter what. Also restaurants frequently charge $5-$10 more for items on the app. Obfuscated fees as well, order 2 drinks from a restaurant? Suddenly you pay a $5 ""handling"" fee. Who receives that fee? Not the driver.","December 9, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pizza Samurai,Google Play Store
"Half the time the order is wrong or worse, doesn't even come without any notification. Uber does nothing about it. In the rare instance they ""issue a credit"" it never shows up on your account and it's not worth another two hours on the phone for $12. It's basically for ""emergencies"" when you're in a city overnight for a layover, but that's about it. But otherwise, love it!","November 17, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lisa Coester,Google Play Store
"Very inconvenient and very expensive service. Advertising offering any discounts will NECESSARILY not work for those places from which you want to order. BUT! Vouchers disappear from the list of coupons when ordering, even if you have not applied them. It's impossible to change anything even if the order time is 2 weeks later. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Ordering food turns into an hard challenge.","December 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Or Bo,Google Play Store
"Total scam of a company and app. You end up paying double or triple what you would if you just ordered from the restaurant directly. Even with uber one: overpriced delviery items, missing sides/drinks, and drivers who can't communicate in English. Worst of all, they don't offer refunds for missing items or your order not being delivered. They say they do, but in my experience and those of multiple people I've talked to over the years, they make the process so unbearable that you give up.","December 12, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dennis Johnson,Google Play Store
"Horrible!!!! Tried to order from my favorite pizza place. A single topping pizza. The app charges extra small pies, the restaurant doesn't. The app, REQUIRED That I add an extra topping, again, Which of course, was an additional charge! a small pizza, that cost $9.75, on the restaurant menu? Ends up costing $22.70 ($3.31 tip added). And that's using uber plus, which doesn't add a delivery charge! So, it requires you add extra toppings, and charges for any size other than a mini. What a scam!","November 30, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,anthonio j,Google Play Store
"Good app, but poor customer service, not able to speak to a human. Poor grocery delivery. Half of my order was not available 😒. I got charged over £6 delivery fee for one item as the other one was unavailable, no option to cancel an order free of charge, not my fault they are selling items that are not available. I'm an Uber one customer, but I'm really thinking of deleting the app. Total rip-off money in delivery fees. There is no option to talk to a human being so frustrating.","December 18, 2023",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Nikolay Ivanov,Google Play Store
Sends drivers to the wrong street. It worked perfectly for years. Now it takes drivers to the next street over. Even after going in to the address and manually moving the locationa little bit and saving it.. It starts off showing correctly but at some stage changes. The blue dot of my actual location is in the right place. Tired of having to walk 500m to find my food sitting in someone elses driveway. I've provided feedback in the app.,"December 7, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Craig Galbraith,Google Play Store
"Prices are crazy high. I tried to cancel an order seconds after placing it and it wanted to charge me $20! I guarantee they hadn't started it yet. Time estimates don't make sense, I've seen the driver be late before but once it's delivered it will say it's here early and expects me to leave a tip? Sometimes even at my door it will say 21 minutes away. Support did not understand this issue is their own. No notification when your order has been dropped off, it just disappears, very strange! Fix it","November 29, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel C,Google Play Store
"Uber Terrible cancelation policy, $16.95. I place an order for delivery instead of pickup. Cancel within minutes and reorder the same for pickup. I'm doing this adjustment while I'm at the restaurant. Call customer service, which the phone number is not easy to find. We told that I have passed my window and there's nothing they can do, not even a one-time courtesy. That's $16.95, didn't mind it if under $10. Uber, be more lenient toward your policy. You are no longer my prioritize choices.","November 20, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phung Huynh,Google Play Store
"Really bad experience time and time again. The interface is about as bad as you want it. No easy way to change qty, restaurants available, after careful selection suddenly not available. Then drivers too far. Then food delivered wet and trashed. Help menus are very limited and automated, never get to talk to a person via the app. I did get my money back by calling a hidden nr I got from someone but many orders are messed up and it has taken way too too much time. 1y later: still bad, slow :(","December 10, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Christophe,Google Play Store
"Got stuck in a feedback loop because one guy picked up my food, never dropped it off, and instead the order just kept getting passed to different drivers while I got no updates whatsoever. I couldn't even get in contact with actual customer support, and when I tried to cancel, it attempted to charge me even though it was at least 30-40 minutes past the latest arrival time. The only way it stopped was because a driver cancelled it, allowing me to not be charged for something out of my control.","December 13, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,jay bird,Google Play Store
"I signed up for promotional Uber One for 1 month, and so did my partner who owns an iPhone. There were different prices, offers, and fees for Android vs iPhone which makes me believe there are deceptive business practices and pricing on the app. In addition, a lot of screen real estate is taken up by popup notifications, offers, ""switch to yearly Uber One"" subscription popups, etc. Also getting tons of ad/promotional push notifications with no option to customize which notifications you receive.","November 18, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Joel Wilson,Google Play Store
"Terrible Customer Service. I reached out for assistance with my account. I stopped receiving promotions and all the promo codes experienced errors and would not apply. I was sent one email and then the rest of my requests were ignored. ""According to the Terms and Conditions, Uber reserves the right to disable promo codes/marketing campaigns.

Bad!","November 26, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jennifer Watson,Google Play Store
"Ordered from the app. Did not receive two of the items. Getting a refund via the app resulted in a paltry refund for less than half the missing items. Have to call support who refund an additional $5 Unfortunately, that doesn't let me reorder the items, because they have to charge a huge fee, and unless you offer a tip of $5 or more, good luck getting a driver to accept the order The app itself can be confusing, and often times a lesson in frustration","November 28, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Twolves,Google Play Store
"I'm an UberOne user. This app sucks, put simply. They charge the resraurant 30% of the profit, meanwhile also marking up prices in the app. Delivery is only free, even for subscribers, if you want your food delivered among other orders in seemingly random succession. Plan on adding at least $3 to every order if you want it delivered directly to you (what used to be a standard feature). My most recent order took an hour. By the time I was able to contact support, it had already arrived luke warm.","January 13, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Daniel L,Google Play Store
"I wish I can post a picture of you can see how much they charge you for a $20 meal it is $7.98 for fees, this has nothing to do with the delivery, which is an additional $1.89! There is absolutely no way you're going to be able to tip the delivery guy with the amount of fees they're charging to! I don't stop using the app, but I absolutely do not tip anymore!

It user to be Easy to use. Very useful. But now if you have issue such as items missing or the restaurant not following orders which means the food goes to waste along with the money.
