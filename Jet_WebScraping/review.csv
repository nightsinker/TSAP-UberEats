"Consistent bad quality food delivered. 6 months now all orders placed through uber eats has been like trash put together and delivered... I've deleted my account and will not continue to use this provider. They allow restaurants to send out bad quality and undercooked food to paying customers... shame on you uber! Vet your providers and hold them to a higher standard when it comes to human food consumption

"Had an issue with the website freezing up/crashing, which resulted in a double order and double charge to my credit card. Uber eats would not do anything other than offer a $25 credit towards future orders. So I am out a $121 extra. I would avoid using this company and try doordash Instead Uber Eats literally doesn't care about their customers.
Tip for consumers:
I tried emailing their corporate officers and reaching out through LinkedIn. Nobody would reply except the horrible customer service who does nothing

"RIPPED OFF and NO Recourse! Absolute Goat-Rope. Yet another business hiding behind COVID-19 for poor customer service. I was overcharged for my order, but have yet to receive a refund. I ordered and paid for two pizzas, but only got one. On top of that, the delivery arrived 35 minutes after the time UberEATS' ‘estimated' time of delivery. To make matters worse, there is ZERO customer support. No call center, no chat... nothing. If/when my refund hits, that App is going in the garbage where it belongs.
Tip for consumers:
Although DoorDash’s isn’t a gold standard service, its customer service is markedly better than UberEATS. During the instances in which there’ve been discrepancies in charges, DoorDash has done a much better job of responding to them and issuing refunds in a far more timely manner. In addition, DoorDash’s estimated times of delivery are much more accurate than Uber’s. I get the impression UberEATS just doesn’t care. They get their payment and they’re done with you. Well, I’m done, too. BEWARE.

"I will no longer be using uber eats as of two days ago. Most of my delivers are delivered problematic. Uber eats determined that did not matter to them even if most of my food order is missing. Uber eats put a refund lock on my account so I could not get a refund. I had argument with a few of them about that not being my fault. But at the end of all of that I ended up deleting my account. The policy is horrible because if I fully pay for my food I expect my full correct order to be delivered. So they definitely lost a customer.

"This was my first time using a food delivery app and tried Uber Eats in Milwaukee. Ordered Indian food from Cafe India. I was 9 minutes down the road. The driver took over an hour, delivered to the wrong address, and hung up on calls many times. Food was stolen as he left it at a gas station! The driver did not speak English and was very rude.

"Normally I'm ok using the app to contact customer service, but not when I have an issue that requires immediate assistance. Not offering a phone support line is cheap, unethical, and very lazy on Uber's part (there is a number if you search the net wide... and I mean wide, but it's an answering service that instructs you to use the app then hangs up on you). Email - no reply also. Crucial components of my order were missing. Not sure if I'll be getting a refund, hours later still waiting to hear back from their not so helpful app ""support"". Very UNenjoyable meals, lacking the very thing that makes them, and no way to get help on the spot when I needed it. Instead, left to source food elsewhere or eat substandard, full-priced meals, whilst feeling ripped off without suitable recourse.

"The absolute worst delivery service ever! I contacted the actual provider and they advised me that since Uber collected the money I had to go through them for the refund. Of course, Uber declined the refund. I'm irritated by both companies. The food delivered was undercooked and tossed in the garbage. Uber just says... no they can't offer a refund. Really?

"Instead of delivering our lunch the driver telephoned to shout at us and tell us he'd put it in the bin. All complaints are met with automated replies and 'bots. If you telephone, a 'bot answers and tells you you're not important enough to bother answering the phone to. If you tweet, a bot promises to look into it and asks for a DM which is answered similarly abysmally by another 'bot.

"NO Phone support. TIME Consuming. Very Buggy both on app and PC... Tried many times to make the same order and this it is frustrating ""Something went wrong"". While the app suddenly decided to go through after the 5th time the app/pc version does not know what it wants... I insert payment method 50% it declines or gives errors.

The first issue I had a weeks back, ordering asian restaurant. A popup for $20 discount was offered, but when got to the end of the cart to order, it said it cant be used? So I decided just to get something locally. Why do you offer something and revert back from it, I find this practice unfair. Was told from CS they sorry to hear and its not how business should be. But there was no resolution.

Secondly. Beware when making orders. Most recently July 7 2021: Went to the 7-11 on Amsterdam ave to pick up items (the order is completed. On the uber eats receipt). I waited 30 minutes just to be told to come back in 2 more hours. I also value my time, l; im not too happy with the whole entire system and unable to communication with merchant directly either. Was not able to reach them by phone either. On top of this the whole order was not fulfilled properly and incomplete. No alternative item or communication was offered. Only ""out of stock, no replacement"" on item receipt thats it! The lost of $5 credit in this case, from the 1 time use voucher with no prior notification.

For this current order I was told to come back in 2 hours to get the order. The pc and app seem to have issues (possible bugs and or missing features) that need to be fixed by a technical team) ordering (this was a hassle just to get this order through). I asked to speak to supervisor? The biggest letdown is lack of compensation from Ubereats; so I plan to switch elsewhere

I ordered from Qdoba because uber eats said delivery would be free if I spent a certain amount. Come to find out that was not and I was charged full price. Didn't realize it until order was placed. Canceled immediately and was still charged $40! Customer service is a joke! They claim its in their policy and can't refund my money. Never again will I use Uber Eats. Stay away! Scam artists.,"September 23rd, 2022",1,Amanda R.,sitejabber
"They have a predatory cancellation fee policy. If you don't cancel within literally 5 seconds of placing the order, UberEats will charge you the full price of the order when you try to cancel. Also beware that the system for cancelling an order is very unclear and it's easy to accidentally cancel the order and be charged full price. Why would anyone, ever, want to cancel an order and be charged the full price? It makes no sense. The only logical explanation is greed. UberEats is the pits.
Tip for consumers:
Just a garbage, predatory service with ZERO human customer support.

Took well over an hour to be delivered and the driver told me to contact customer support as she didn't agree with the long delivery time.

"Not that I like any of the food delivery apps as they are ripping off customers with their myriad opaque fees. However, I have found that Uber Eats is worse. Not for opaque fees so much but in the delivery process itself. Since it's an Uber driver who will be delivering the food oftentimes the driver makes at least one stop before delivering our food. Thus, it's a pain if one is in a hurry to eat and worse the food is oftentimes lukewarm when it's delivered due to their additional stops.

They partner with food places that are crappy as the food place just kept blaming the driver, I am expecting Uber eats to refund the full sum of $57 for the food and delivery immediately.

"I've ordered with Uber eats a few times and almost every experience has been awful. The prices are ridiculously upcgarged, the deliveries are extremely slow, and the customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. Just tonight I was missing some items from my order, so I contacted support and told them about my issue. They responded with the most non-human response they could have ""I'm sorry but this order isn't eligible for a refund"". I wasn't looking for a full refund, I just wanted the money back from what I didn't receive. I tried contacting them again 3 more times and they basically gave me the same answer each time and closed the conversation right after they sent their message. 0/10 in every category I can imagine. Definitely would stay away from Uber eats.

"Today I ordered blueberries and raspberries as well as some frozen items from Target using Uber eats. When I went to wash the raspberries there was some mold outside but mold inside most of the raspberries. I took a picture and asked customer service to either refund the money or call Target so that I could pick up some good raspberries this week. They refused both and said there was nothing they could do. So use Uber eats to shop or dine in at your own risk. Yesterday when I ordered the same two items I did not get either of them so some of their shoppers need training. Before that, a shopper brought me tuna in a paper pack instead of chicken in a can. This is in spite of having photos of the items they are shopping for. Uber eats repeatedly asked me to give the shopper today a bad rating but that would not be fair to him as the mold may not have been something he would know to look for. Now this is interesting as Uber eats has no problem asking the customer to poorly rate the shopper when that person needs to make a living. Target would reimburse Uber eats for bad product but Uber eats does not consider it worth their time and would rather have food safety issues they refuse to address and poor customer relations. Beware big tech.

Still, the driver was posted to a street name with no house number. Understandably, the driver could not find me and canceled my order.
Uber eats WON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY.
Totally scrap compan. One can understand that they charge for delivery and packing, but incredibly they charge for the entire purchase that was not delivered.

"This was my first experience with Uber eats, and it was absolutely terrible, I will never use them again. I ordered groceries, received two extra items ($23 more than what I approved) and then was charged a $9 service fee on top of it, AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER. I contacted customer service and not only were they unhelpful and unprofessional, but they were also screwing with me, which included disconnecting me when I ask for a manager twice. I called to complain and the second rep refunded the money for the extra items, but would barely acknowledge my frustrations with the previous rep. He put me on hold to look into the service fee and then hung up on me! I called back and spoke to a female, who wouldn't even try to find the person I was previously speaking with, and then told me they wouldn't be refunding the service fee I did not approve. It was almost as if the previous rep prepped her for the call… She basically told me they would rather lose my business than make it right. If I could give negative stars, I would. Someone needs to look into a Uber regarding these fees they're adding. There's no way that's legal!

"What an incredible rip off. I got Chick-fil-a and thought it was pretty over priced so when I got home I pulled up their online menu to compare the price for pickup to the price I paid Uber.

First thing is notice it that the menu items are 30 percent more expensive on the Uber menu.

Then there is a 3.16 ""Service Fee""

Then 1.99 Delivery fee.

Then a tip for the driver, 4.13

So ordering my food at the store or online for pickup for my Chicken sammich and chocolate milkshake would have cost 10.44. Final cost through Uber Eats, 24.78

I submitted a claim to UberEats with a picture showing the receipt for the order with the name ""Andrew"" and only four items purchased (my name is Jennifer and we purchased six food items). Customer Service responded two days later stating that I was not eligible for a refund because I've submitted a large number of refund requests in the past. I have literally only ever used Uber Eats to order food four times ever and have never submitted a refund request through the platform before this. When I tried to challenge it, they just kept replying standard messages that I was not eligible after reviewing their policies. $25 worth of food plus tax, delivery fee, and tip down the drain ($33 total) because the order was freezing cold and completely different than what I had ordered. Needless to say, I won't be using Uber Eats in the future. At least GrubHub gives me a window where I can still call the driver and address the matter appropriately.

"I recently ordered a meal and cancelled it within minutes. Re ordered and got that one. After a month I got billed for both. When I complained they told me sorry after 48 hours nothing they can do. My app shows it is cancelled and I ordered from the same restaurant, so the food was not spoiled in fact went up I added more items. So in essence, they take your money, charge you later, even if your app says cancelled, and then blame the timeline. WHAT A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN! Never again go elsewhere and save your money.

"Should receive a negative star - review.
Upon being a gold member, I have paid extra fees for agents to deny my request for corporate (11 times) had my account threatened for reporting violations, missing food, unsanitary/unhealthy food items, wrong orders, food being added after informing of allergic reactions to wrong items on food, ect. Apparently when restaurants charge your cc for items they give you, you report to Uber, Uber penalizes the customer for reporting these thefts, dishonest/unsanitary driver's(some, not all), missing/cold/rotten food, all of which is categorized by Uber within the Uber app and outlined when a customer becomes a member, because Uber is so thirsty/hard up for businesses to contract with them, they (Uber eats) excuses theft, stolen funds, falsifying/incorrect items, then send you an email as if you (customer) hurts the community and business practices because you (customer) are reporting theft, no orders being delivered, wrong orders, ect.

Be cautious, this company may or may not threaten to hold you (customer) accountable for too many errors (caused by contracted stores/restaurants), dishonest delivery drivers, and or refunds given at the discretion of (Uber) regardless if you requested or not.

"Worst customer service experience, liars!
I placed an order which had buy one get one free promotion going on. Immediately after placing the order, I realized the promotion did not apply and I was overcharged. I called the restaurant and they said they cannot do anything. I contacted Uber eats support, who on chat asked for screenshots, and when provided, said price will be adjusted and I should wait. The charge finalized and price was not adjusted. I contacted them again, they told me they cannot do anything because I contacted them after 48 hours! I explained multiple times that I had contacted immediately and was told to wait and now I am being told that I should have contacted immediately. After getting same message again, the chat was ended by Uber. It is not about the miniscule charge of extra 10 dollars but a matter of principle, they are a money greedy company with shady customer service practices.

"HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE WITH UBEREATS,

Its taken them a couple of days to refund an $8 promo that was running on their platform.

Their agents ended chats abruptly and gave me wrong estimates of delivery times - basically devaluing their own platform for wait times (which turned out to be accurate).

I got a $3.80 compensation in cash for waiting for more than an hour and a half for my delivery. My poor driver then informs me that they added another delivery to her route when my delivery was already late!

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! Going back to Skip.

"Never expect to get a refund from UberEats! Their customer service is useless! I ordered 6 pints of ice-cream with UberEats. They arrived already melted and slushy like milkshake; the content spilled everywhere in the bag. It is a safety issue to eat ice-cream that has already melted in the heat. The ice-cream did not come in proper packaging -- not fully sealed containers but iced drink containers with stickers to cover the huge openings on top. Also, my order did not come with a cool bag like it did last time. I talked to manager at the ice-cream shop and she agreed to fully refund me for this order through Ubereats. I got 2 messages from Ubereats the next day; they were very similar in their content and rather generic. I believe these copy-and-paste messages are used to deal with all types of customer disssatifaction. The message instructed me to express my concern in their app review (btw, I had already done twice), but even then, UberEats continued to refuse to provide any refund despite the ice-cream shop manager's consent. UberEats do not take complaint seriously and they will never take responsibility for their poor service, not even when there is a mutual agreement for refund between their business partner and customer. Their nonexistent customer service and low integrity do not deserve their expensive fee charge. I am closing my Ubereats account.

A few hours later I received an email stating I was being charged $3. For what - who knows. I figured out how to connect with someone (this is difficult as there are no direct contact links on their site) and the first person with whom I chatted basically hung up on me. I stayed on and got another rep - who eventually gave me $3 in Uber credit... So - for not receiving delivery, spending an hour on chat I was charged $3 and then give a measly $3 in Uber credit so I would be forced to use their services again. DO NOT USE UBEREATS - they do not take care of their customers and there are so many other services out there that are customer focused. Shame on Uber.

"My partner ordered UberEats while she was at work, so I was waiting outside at the mailbox for the driver. Jasmine in her black Nissan Ultima zooms right by. I'm the only one standing on a suburban street. Goes out of sight. Comes back, goes right on by. I realize there's an issue, so I point at the number on my mailbox 7421 in 3"" luminous numbers. She comes back, stops and says ""Is this 7421?"" I was astonished! I asked ""Can you honestly not see these numbers?"" The driver then threw my food on me. Uber promised to refund the cost of the meal, and send a replacement meal, but walked that back an hour later. Instead, I got no food and they charged me $8 for the privilege of being attacked. Police were involved, and incident report taken. Beware! If your Uber driver is a very large black woman named Jasmine, you're probably better off just cutting your losses and forgetting about the food. That thing is stone blind and on a steroid rage.
Tip for consumers:
Think very carefully. Uber obviously takes no responsibility for dangerous lunatics that come TO YOUR HOUSE. In the light of this agent's behavior and Uber's unwillingness to investigate, I consider business with them to be a grave security risk. If you accept the risk, be sure you are in view of a camera, and having a gun is not a bad idea.

I ordered again today 2. 1. 22 and same thing. Missing half the order, same speech. The only app that this happens with. So once again I will have to grab something from the fridge so my son and wife don't have to eat cold food.

Awesome job Uber eats.

"The company has zero care for your food order. Will happily tell you it's int be way for hours before suddenly cancelling.

No accountability for drivers just $#*!ing off and cancelling mid delivery. No funxtiinal customer support service. Just a few people that tactically avoid contact with customers by ignoring their messages and lying and saying goodbye.

Terrible terrible service. Highly recommend to avoid it.

This company does not deserve your money based on the way it treats it's customers and service.

"Uber Eats is one of those less-than-ethical apps that inserts itself above the website you really wanted to get to, hoping to confuse you into paying a lot more for the food you wanted, even if your original intent and expressed choice on the Uber Eats site is Pick Up. Appalling. Check your URL carefully to make certain it's for the site you wanted--not a sneaky app like Uber Eats.

"Uber Eats is awful. The driver can cancel your order for any reason they want and WHENEVER they want. A driver just cancelled our order an hour after we placed our order (originally it was supposed to get there in 40 minutes). This time the ""system was down"" and last time we ordered ""they didn't have some of the items you wanted."" So you just cancel the whole thing? Ridiculous. The customer service is garbage as they make you use a chat feature that is not compatible with certain phones. I'd say go with Doordash, they are MUCH better. They will call you for replacement item.

"I'm a driver. Walmart just recently joined UberEats and many times they have bulk orders of just packages that need delivered. My biggest complaint is that UberEats will send out an amount of like $27 for six packages which they estimate will take an hour and almost sixty miles. Well already that's just saving Walmart on shipping. But then when you get them finished up delivering, Walmart pays you $8. I've tried talking to customer service and they say it's just an estimate what they send you; however no one would accept a delivery of almost 60 miles and one hour for $8 and it's their own car? How is UberEats getting away with this? They refuse to pay what they offer the driver. How do you know you can actually accept a ride based on that offer if they don't have to pay you that? When is someone going to do something about the unfairness of Uber and UberEats and their drivers. Gas prices are through the roof and we are using our own cars. We are getting less than minimum wage. They've lowered payment to their drivers for restaurants even lower than DoorDash now which is $2 per order…so if a customer doesn't give a big tip they decline that order. Some customers are getting their food super cold because Uber won't offer a decent fare until it's went to many other drivers. One customer told me he had waited two hours to get his order from IHOP. It was cold of course. The price was decent for me which included a tip but them not paying me what's promised and saying it's based on mileage is BS and someone needs to call them on it. I'll be the first to join a suit against them.

"In the same day, one order was canceled when it was a minute away (I do not live in a complex or anything that could be considered difficult to get around) and another order placed itself due to a glitch on the app. When I attempted to find a hotline or customer support I was first greeted by a chat robot and then a useless representative who when did not know what to say simply inserted the same pre-written response. That day I had to place another order with the money refunded (which should come with a free delivery as well) and my order which was 1 sandwich from a subway less than 2 miles away arrived 45 minutes later, cold and dripping from the bag. The order which I never placed ended up only refunding me 7 dollars from a total of 30 (cancellation fee?) even after cancelling less than 30 seconds after.

"I'm learning to hate the service Uber Eats provides. It starts from the beginning of the experience. As you are considering where to order from Uber Eats tells you a window of time that this particular restaurant can fill your order. Every time i have placed an order the delivery window comes back as longer than advertised. I have never appreciated a ""bait and switch"" but if I'm hungry and the additional time isn't completely aggravating wont cancel my order. Tonight started with these familiar annoyances...and then got worse! Ten minutes after placing my order I get an announcement on the app, ""Oops there has been a problem."" No other details and the latest delivery time has gone from 10 minutes longer than advertised to 37 minutes longer than advertised when I ordered. I tried to get through to a human via the app on my phone. That process is needlessly annoying and did nothing to encourage me to be calm as I waited for 15 additional minutes after the app said I was being connected to a customer service rep! Why is it that Uber Eats doesn't seem to understand that if a customer is angry enough to contact customer service it is in the company's best interest not to create an experience that adds to the customer's sense of being poorly served. The customer service rep on the app stopped responding after a few questions leaving me without answers, satisfaction or enough time remaining to cancel my order. So food arrived 57 minutes after ordering instead of 20 and what was delivered came in damaged packaging and ice cold...which would have been fine if I'd ordered ice cream but I'd ordered a hot meal. I don't know who will read this review but if you are anything like me you see no reason to be charged for the privilege of being told substandard and ineffectual delivery service is worth the expense because it allows you to order something other than pizza or Chinese food. Uber Eats, if you are listening or reading, the service you currently provide is not at all worth the fees you charge and if it were possible to launch legal action over your bait and switch tactics at the time of ordering I would be very happy to meet your lawyers in court. As it is I must be satisfied with writing this review and then copying it to every online forum I can find.

"UberEATS started out as a useful service, especially during the height of the pandemic. But of late it's been nothing but a scam. Items missing from orders with no real refunds given. Cold food. Long waits. Useless customer service.

Today, while home sick, I ordered some dry goods, and drinks from a grocer. I ended up only getting the three drinks, which ended up being >$20 after fees. Nothing else. Had I known, I would have cancelled the order! But when I saw the store cancelling the other items and tried to cancel the order, I was faced with even more fees for nothing.

Wanna cancel your account through the app? Nope, you're gonna have to argue with customer service for that.

"I had a horrible experience today with Uber Eats!
The woman driver didn't want to come up even though it was noted into my order which they agreed to!
She called me 3 times in my phone and I explained that I can't go down as I'm alone with a a baby and that I can't leave the baby alone!
She then started demanding my pin and I said I won't give until I get the food to my door.
She buzzed and I opened the door for her. She came to second floor where my flat is and knocked on the door so hard that she woke the baby up (purposely obviously).
Then she again demanded the pin where I said pls give me the food and I'll give u the code. She then spat on the delivery bag with my food and marched off with my food!
Then she marked as delivers coz obviously she knows that last 4 numbers of ur phone is the pin!
Nevertheless, among all the communication with Uber they said they will not refund me for food that I've ordered and have not received! I'm discussed and disappointed and this is so not fair! No justice!

Please just order directly from the business and walk 5 to 10 minutes to grab your food. More profit for your average joe businesses.
Tip for consumers:
No help. No body I can talk to. It's not worth the trouble.
I wasted my precious time and energy just to feel awful instead enjoying the food when they were the ones who made the mistake.
(It's not the restaurant's fault, it's Uber's poor quality app)

"Terrible customer service. I wanted to cancel an order almost immediately after I made it. The restaurant advised me they couldn't do it and I'd have to call Uber Eats. The agent I spoke with when I called gave me completely incorrect information about how I should proceed (which basically resulted in me being unable to cancel the order at all). I then found it almost impossible to raise a complaint about this, the app only gives you options to complain about the food or the delivery driver, neither of whom were at fault. If I had been told that what I wanted to do was not possible by the agent I spoke with due to policy of whatever - ok but to essentially lie to get me off the phone is really shocking customer service.

After spending over an hour and a half arguing with customer service, I was pretty much told that I was $#*! out of luck. ""Unfortunately your order isn't eligible for a refund at this time"". They were real $#*!s about it making me wait literally 15-20 mins for a half $#*! computerized response. At this point when you place an order on UberEats - you're just playing Russian Roulette. You're a vegetarian? I'm sure they would send you meat and then refuse to help you at all. But, thanks for spending money on something you're not going to eat! Absolutely ridiculous. They need actual customer service individuals who will actually do their job.

"I've had too many bad experiences with them at this point so this time, I'm done with them. Customer service is a joke and I'm really fed up with their arrogance. I'm supposed to get $120 back from superbowl Sunday because the restaurant canceled, they didn't have any of those foods and didn't know why that menu was even up, i got the money back from my bank, but then my bank reversed the charges due to Uber eats writing an email to them that I didn't cancel in a timely manner and had enough time to change my order, myself and the manager of the restaurant called uber eats and burnt we were getting somewhere with them. Nope! So I never got my money back, I honestly don't know why I still used them after that but today was the last time. I ordered breakfast from McDonald's and this location does suck, because they always leave things out of the order. This time was no different from the other times. If there were other McDonald's locations to choose from at that time, then I would have. I basically have long Covid so almost everything smells and tastes rotten to me. One of the only things that I can eat is the egg and cheese McGriddle. I basically have no choice sometimes, especially since I do not drive. They forgot something in the order for my son and also filled up his drink only halfway. That's unacceptable. I went back and forth with Uber eats customer service and nothing got resolved. I think the workers feel like they are too above everyone else and are untouchable. The company itself is not good at all. No supervisor ever called me back no matter how many times that I called. They get away with too much and I will be going to the courts to try to sue them. This is beyond ridiculous already.

I asked for an explaination and went back and forth for more times than I'd like to mention with the response being the same. I do not understand hoe receiving 2/3rd of my order does not constitute some sort of refund. Its not the delivery person's fault or even ubereats but shouldn't they do the leg work required. This is ridiculous and I've now resorted to never utilizing them again if I cannot receive money back on missing items. It should be renamed take your chances.

"We have tried UberEats twice now. The first time a few weeks ago me and my two friends ordered burgers. It took over 1 1/2 hours for the delivery and when the driver arrived, she handed us our bag and said ""enjoy your $20 burger"" like a snob.

Last night we attempted it once again as we order from Buffalo Wild Wings. We received notification that the driver had picked up our order but would be making another delivery first. After 1 hour 40 min we received notification our order was delivered? We were sitting in our garage with drinks and nobody EVER showed up! I was refunded for the meal but lost the tip money for the driver.

So the driver decided, nah. I ain't driving out there, kept the food, made the same tip and screwed the customer who had been waiting for nearly two hours for their meal.

Fooled once shame on them, fooled twice shame on me this time. I've never had a bad experience with DoorDash and I'm sorry I tried something different. That will NEVER happen again.

Once you reach customer support, their willingness to help you rivals the willingness of an insurance company required to pay out claims. They'll do anything to avoid actually helping you.

"I signed up with them and used them one time. I liked the driver and the online way to track the delivery. Fortunately, there was driver information (photo, phone number), as I had to call him. The reason for the call was ridiculous, and here's the story: I use a PC, not the phone app, and when I signed up on the site, I eventually realized that the system did not ask for my address, just an e-mail to verify the account and a phone number. I had to call the driver to give him my address. He was very pleasant and delivered the food without a problem. I spent a lot of time afterwards researching how I could enter an address for future deliveries. Directions on the site for changing an address through the app were given, but there is no way to deal with address issues on the web site. Also, I researched on the site and then on Google to try to find a way to contact the company. I found a phone number that doesn't take calls, and there is no way to e-mail them. From reading other reviews here, apparently using the phone app isn't necessarily an effective way to make contact either. I eventually gave up and requested that the account be deleted. I guess the system is able to help in only that way. I got a ""forced choice"" listing of reasons to select why I was leaving. I selected ""problems with ubereats"" and expected that the next screen would give me a narrative box to record my problem. But, NO! I got a thank you and that's it. What a bad way to lose a customer who would have given them a try.

Think twice about using this app since you might not get your order. It also doesn't automatically refund your tip amount even if you've indicated you didn't get your order. Why should someone be entitled to a tip when they didn't do their job?

They also delivered a package of baby carrots with water leaking from the carrots.

I mean, I get it if I'm trying to cater a 20 person party that there would be some extra fees, but just tacking on fees just to improve your bottom line isn't worth it to me. Go with doordash instead. I mean, they'll still hire any idiot with a drivers license and a 10 year old car to deliver your food, but they charge less for it. The image is literally the cost of having 2 cheeseburgers and a small order of fries. I mean, I'm happy to tip 6 or 7 bucks, but not on top of a 5 or 6 dollar fee. If this is the fee for a couple of burgers I can only imagine what a family of 4 is paying in fees. Definitely not worth it. The food is almost never hot and fresh and with the price you can almost just call a taxi service to take you through the drive thru for less.

"Ubereats keeps sending me ""deals"" through email and I spend who knows how long making the perfect order just for the deal to not work for whatever reason, literally won't even tell me why just that my account isn't eligible or some other bull. Then this weekend I decided to do the uber eats plus or whatever trial to get the $30 discount and the order actually went through, it got all the way to being delivered then it was just cancelled out of nowhere for literally no reason. And now they won't even give me the discount back either. Ridiculous. I'd use doordash over this crap any day, even though they got plenty of their own problems.

"I contacted uber eats regarding a foreign charge I noticed on my bank account. I informed them that I had not made the nearly $99 purchase. Upon investigation, they determined the account had a completely different email and everything. They asked me to verify my credentials, which i did. Not my email, dont know where it was delivered. Obvious fraud! However, they refused to further investigate. No reversal of fees, no notice to the other account, nothing! I'm stuck paying the money and there is no one I can even talk to about it. I've been a member of uber 1 for years, that ends today! All these new businesses that eliminate live customer service just to save money, truly don't care at all about the consumer.

"We all know Uber Eats is not free. They have fees and tips on top of taxes and cost of order. They don't care if the order is wrong, if you have missing items or if there is a constant complaint with one specific restaurant. Instead, they blacklist you for making too making complaints or requests with no attempts to reach out to those restaurants or blacklist them for inaccurate service. But again, we can't complain with our hard earn money. Too many orders are wrong or have missing items and they do nothing about the order or OUR money. Are they paying? NO! But they sure aren't correcting issues either. This Burger King in Houston did not send me a frozen coke—I got a regular—completely forgot to include my whopper, ice cream that resembles a milkshake, sent me overly cooked, cold and salty onion rings and nuggets, provided no condiments or utensils whatsoever and do not bother answering their phone (neither web nor receipt number). Trust me, I called within 2 minutes of my delivery and got no answer anywhere. Uber doesn't ever help—they disclaim but are quick to take your money and if you've made more than one complaint (yet you have dozens of cab rides and food orders under your belt) you get an automated message about why they won't assist or refund you. Now I don't want a refund, I want to give bad reviews for service. If I could report them to the bbb, I would. Everyone who gives bad service should be reported. PERIODT!

I ordered weeks in advance, and then 10 minutes before it was to be delivered (the Sat before Easter brunch), Uber Ears sent a message saying the restaurant cancelled my order. I called the restaurant in a frenzy, and the lovely man working said Uber Eats forgot to send in all their orders, and there were many people in a pickle.

"You keep sending me offers for 50% off my food delivery. It's a nice gesture, but my experience has been ridiculously bad. Every time I receive these offers I try to order and every time there are virtually no drivers available for any of the restaurants that I want to order from. If you don't have any drivers available for food delivery, why do you offer the discount or the service? Every other delivery service in the Portland Maine market, and there are many, are capable of picking up food at the restaurant of my choice and deliver it to my door in a reasonable amount of time. Why can't you? It has been so disappointing and infuriating that I have deleted your food app from my phone and I delete the offers as soon as they land in my inbox. I'm curious, do you actually consider this to be good customer service? For me it's terrible customer service and just makes me angry and frustrated. It's dumbfounded to me that you can offer an excellent rider service but you don't seem capable of getting this to work right. What is the problem?

"Uber Eats review…

This company is a scam!
Most of the time the order is wrong, missing half of what you wanted, cold and disgusting after waiting over an hour, or simply just never shows up.
Want to talk to a supervisor? Calling customer service? Good luck on that. Useless! NO help whatsoever! They will NOT call you back. You can put in unlimited number of complaints until your black and blue in the face, they don't listen and will still charge you. Email? Again…. Useless! They continue to repeat how sorry they are and this order isn't eligible for a refund at this time.

This is the worst service in the US. Do NOT use them. You will end up like the rest of us. Upset!
I tried DoorDash. Had another hiccup. I couldn't find my food because the driver left my food in the bushes! I complained and received a full refund. Now that's great service! DoorDash is legit!

"Used Uber Eats last night for food to be delivered from a restaurant a 5 minute walk away. Unfortunately it took Wieslaw 20 minutes by car to deliver it. Apparently he was dropping off several other meals on the way. This delay in our delivery made our $70 meal cold soggy and inedible. We paid our delivery fee in good faith that our meal would be delivered in reasonable time, 20 minutes is not reasonable. We will definitely think twice about using Uber Eats again and wasting another $70 worth of food.

"UberEats was unable to find a driver (not our fault), so after several delays and not receiving food, we cancelled order. I was told that there is nothing you can do after 5 mins. Why would I cancel the order if I was getting my food? And how would I know that within 5 minutes. Our kids were waiting to eat and this wasnt a cheap order. I have reached out both via e mail and chat with failed attempts for resolution! Not only did you take our money, make us wait on our food, but you did not have a driver to pick up our food (false advertisement), and now through my several attempts for resolution, you are stating that it is not possible after 5 minutes. This does not even make any sense! Why would I cancel my order if I was getting it? And how would I know that in 5 minutes?

"I still used uber eats cause it was convenient. Even After meals being delivered hours late, not being delivered at all, or left at the wrong place. I still used them after their gps gave drivers completely wrong directions to my house. The final straw was being charged the following charges for a meal totaling $17.01. I was charged $9.99, $2.00, $29.42,$29.50, $15.01. I was charged $85.92 for a $17.01 delivery! When I notified them of the overcharge they told me the charges were authorizations and theyd drop off. Its now well past the time frame for authorizations to drop off and all i get is they cant find the charges. Another department will contact me. As im researching these charges i find additional charges on another date. On june 20th I was overcharged $26.95 & $28.66. These charges to this day still show as pending charges. Uber eats claim these are valid. I used there service quite a bit. Id absolutely walk miles in this heat before ever using them again.
Tip for consumers:
It’d be helpful to know they have overcharged people almost $100 for a meal. It’d have been helpful to know that paying the extra for faster delivery means nothing. That they will deliver food literally hours late abd expect you to pay for it. They’ll want to guve you a credit. Honestly i said i was gonna stop using them forever ago but I continued to use them and this is what i got. Do yourself a favor use grubhub or doordash

"I use GrubHub and DoorDash and have never experienced such unprofessionalism and awful customer service. Oh I was notified that my order was picked up 45 minutes after I placed the order and then got notice that the order was just canceled. They refused to redeliver or do anything to make up for this incredible inconvenience. There is no ability to speak to any buddy and they do not offer you to redeliver or credit your account. I am canceling with them and will stick with DoorDash Who offers great customer service.

"Ordered Uber Eats from McAlister's Deli, Lafayette, LA last night. Paid extra for quick delivery. The ""Rachel"" Sandwich (my favorite) $12.00. Arrived cold, dry, and SOGGY at the same time. Ended up $26 with tip. Never again. Ever Uber Eats...I keep saying it but? You've FAILED EVERYTIME. You have managed to cause me to boycott my favorite restaurants because of your poor service. I know you don't care...you think ""well millennials will keep ordering"". You are destroying the restaurant industry with your COVID excuses. You had the industry given to you- you cannalbalized the opportunity with continued horrible service, apathy, and tone deaf management. And now you think you will do medical Uber to transport patients? Sad, sorry profit mongers living off drivers and restaurants.

"I decided to try their 40 percent off $50.00 on groceries. My bill came up $56.00 and after the discount it was $41.00. I added $3.00 tip. Then whilst they were processing the order they said they were out of bread( I ordered 3) and no banana. So this is where I got ripped off, they said it's below $50 so I can't get the promotion and now my bill is $58.00 plus tip with No Bread and banana. Imagine I got $20.00 worth of groceries for $60.00. I will never ever use their app. They are a con and fraud, taking advantage of consumers.

"Uber eats is an organization of crooks. Their delivery driver dropped my food at the WRONG ADDRESS, then sent me a pic of him leaving it at the wrong address, then left no way for me to contact him during the delivery period, then I talked to 3 customer service reps who all refused to refund my money because the driver left the food in the ""pinned location"", even though I never pinned my location on any map because I manually typed my address into the delivery address, and then they hung up in my face, twice. They refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor. The fourth rep claimed a supervisor th the name of Cy was going to call me back within 24 hours but she/he did not. This situation is entirely their fault as I have had the same address typed in my Uber app for two years and they've never delivered my food to the wrong address. Furthermore, it was their gps that pinned my location in the wrong place, not me. They stole a hundred dollars from me and refuse to allow me to speak to a supervisor about refunding jay kinetic, and the reps can barely speak any English and are completely unprofessional.

"Not every driver has an excellent running vehicle anymore, more and more need to literally survive on these ""gig"" independent contracting driving jobs are just that actual jobs and stopped being gigs years ago. Drivers will need base pay or customers can happily get their own goods. UberEATS lowering prices for customers making the delivery drives longer, in turn wrecking havoc on unreliable cars that a driver is unsure of, and UberEATS will no longer sustain smarter drivers who know 32 miles for a $2 fare with no tip is not worth it. Taking away rating driver's options for increasingly rude restaurant staff and customers? And these customers we can't rate for being low born tight fists mocking struggling drivers by requesting $1-$2 fares from places that are near them, but instead request from places really far because the fare is cheaper that way.

Uber Eats in Winter Haven, Florida refuses to make refunds or issue credits when they make mistakes on your order and leave items you have paid for out depending on which restaurant you order from.

"Apparently there is a limit to how many times you can complain to Uber Eats and expect a refund. I have no idea what the limit is, but it seems we've reached it. It's not like we complain over nothing either. Every time I've complained it's because I didn't get what I paid for. The restaurant forgot to put it in the bag (or put something else in the bag by mistake), the driver delivered it to the wrong house, or someone else's order was delivered by mistake.

Yesterday morning, we ordered from Timmies through Uber Eats. The driver came and dropped off someone else's order. Simple human error, right? I tried calling the driver twice and got voicemail, so I clicked ""help"" on my app, submitted a picture of the receipt on the order we received, and re-ordered. We were all hungry and I had no doubt I would get my refund later.

Hours later, I got a generic ""we're sorry, we've passed on your feedback"" e-mail. I thought it must be another human error. I tried to find another way to contact Uber about it. No phone number, so I tried facebook messenger. I sent a screenshot of the e-mail and explained the situation. They asked for more information and said they'd look into it.

Here is the response I got:
""We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Looking at your account, we've noticed that you have multiple requests for refunds and adjustments on your orders. We've also made a note about this issue and be sure that your feedback has been heard regarding this matter. We have processes in place to review this type of feedback with restaurants and the delivery drivers, so your concern hasn't gone unnoticed. We appreciate your understanding.""

A driver mistakenly dropped off a wrap and a tea (and no donuts even though they were on the receipt) instead of the 4 sandwiches, 3 drinks, chocolate croissant and donut I had ordered... and I can't get a refund. Because I have requested refunds too often. Because restaurants and drivers (and humans in general) make mistakes.

Other services are better anyways, in my opinion, Uber Eats just lures me in with their deals sometimes... Definitely won't be using it again.
Tip for consumers:
They won't give refunds if you keep asking for them, even if they keep messing up.

Their customer service seems to be coming from a call center from the country of India, the reps don't care about providing sensible customer service requests and often time they are hard to understand with their heavy foreign accents.

"I am a small business restaurant owner and I keep losing money because of Uber eats. I never signed up to be a partner for uber eats but due to increasing demand for our food uber sends drivers to come in to our place and place orders like a takeout customer, After the order is made and its time for them to pay, the uber drivers card gets declined. Then they find out the order is cancelled and says well sorry the order is cancelled and i cant pay for it and leaves leaving me with the food already prepared and money not paid. This has happened to me several times already and there is nowhere I can call to complain or get my money back for the food thats been ordered and not paid for.

"If your a customer of Uber Eats they screw you with all the fees and underhanded charges and give poor service at best to the customer when theirs a problem with their order. I drive for Uber Eats and have issues with orders on a daily basis. The driver get screwed on their pay for the last two months they have been offering deliveries for sixty eight cents a mile fifty cents a mile etc..., less then a dollar a mile and expect you to drive 10 miles. Gas is over five dollars a gallon in my market and these guys think I have vanity plates which reads charity. I'm probibly going to shut down in a few months cause I'm tired of the daily prostate exam from Dara Ubers CEO. Bend over and grab your ancles is not the gig job I applied for!

"Ordered meal, Uber said it was received and that it was being processed, then 20 minutes later a driver was assigned, nothing, then another driver was assigned, nothing, final a third who called me and told me the restaurant was closed. Uber lied saying the restaurant had the order and was working on it. How can a business be that bad. Going back to Door Dash, there bad, but at least the restaurants exist

"Uber Eats is the worst Delivery app ever. Everytime I place an order before 11 pm and it goes through fine but then only says ""Order recieved, working on it now and everytime I call the place I order from and they say no order came through. And then it says ""No Couriers nearby"" so no one to pick up order. And then it will just go back and forth from ""No Couriers neaby"" to ""Accepting Orders etc"" I waited over an hour and ended up having to cancel the order. On top of that there is no Customer Service by phone and it's a miracle if You even get any help within 3 hours. You get charged for almost the entire amount of the order if You canc it while it says""*Preparing"" even though You won't even get the order because of No Couriers available or the Store is closed. I will not be ordering again from that horrible app from Hell.

"Placed an order and it was marked as delivered. It was never delivered. Had my phone on me so I know that driver didn't try to call.
His name was James John in the san diego area.
So I called customer service and they did give me the refund. Bht by the time everything happened most of the restaurants were already closed and I had no food options anymore. Asked them for some credit on my account since it was a big inconvenience to me. If the lady had just said she couldn't do it, I'd be kind of okay. But she said that it wasn't possible because the UberEats company has nothing to do or can take any responsibility for their drivers. WHAT? It's a driver that carries your company name on it and you say you have no responsibility for it? Completely unreliable service. Never using ubereats again and putting up reviews in every platform I can find! Customer should find another delivery app!

"Take your pick between body part or animal, Uber Eats offers perhaps the WORST customer service of any business I have ever dealt with. Three times in a row I have ordered food after 1am, only to have the food finally arrive after an hour. I have to complain to a robot in order to have my driver changed, and they offer only a template response as to why I should continue to wait. I expressed multiple times that the food would be cold, and was refused the opportunity to cancel or reorder. Of course, when my burger arrived with resolidified cheese, I did not receive a refund, even though any idiot with 4 thumbs could figure out a way to resolve the issue.

"Tried first order with UberEats tonight and I learned my lesson! Will never order again. Started an order using the app; got closer to checkout and saw $73 total for $59 worth of food with no explanation of the additional charges. Went to next screen, thinking the charges would be explained and I'd be given a chance to review, but instead the order submitted. I quickly hit the 'back' key in the app to go to the previous screens. Never got a text message order confirmation, nor any email receipt, and nothing showed up in the Activity tab of the app - so I naturally assumed somehow the order had not gone through. I ordered food from another place, picked it up, came home and started eating. 30 mins later, my UberEats order arrives and I see I was charged an additional $9 tip that I did NOT AUTHORIZE. Chatted with Uber support, no luck, refused to reimburse or even refund the 8.99 service fee. Well, lesson learned -- I'll never, ever use UberEats again.

The delivery driver turned up at the wrong address despite me providing additional delivery notes on my order (I could track their location on the app). I messaged the driver with directions from where they were to my place as it was only a street away. I called them and explained it clearly also. They travelling partway to my place then turned around again. When I called to find out what was going on they told me to meet them on the main road. I was on my own with a newborn baby so said that wasn't an option and that they'd have to deliver to the address on the order. They just marked the order as complete and I never received anything or was able to get through to them again.

When the food was finally on the way, I noticed that the driver was sitting in one spot on the app for at least 10 minutes. I tried contacting her and there was no response. I called the Customer Service. When the attendant finally picked up, the person offered my $2.20 for my trouble. I asked if they was serious. The reply was that they can only give 20% of the order. That was an insult and to top it off, I was told basically to wait for the cold food and take the $2.20 or cancel the order. There was no sorry, let's try to make it right, no let's check on the poor driver who is stuck somewhere out there for 30 minutes. DO NOT order from them.

"I've used Uber Eats for well over a year now. The other night I told my mom to order food off of her account. We live in West Palm Beach FL and we have access to all kinds of food. We were having a few friends over for pizza and wings from a local establishment. We placed the order earlier in the day for it to be delivered@ 8:30pm-@ 8:30pm we got an alert saying our order had been cancelled, first I called the restaurant to ask them what had happened- the restaurant had told me that they made the food and an Uber driver came to pick it up and shortly after he picked it up HE cancelled the order on his end. I contacted customer support for Uber Eats demanding them for an explanation because at this point I am starting to believe this person just stole our order- 85$ worth of food. I asked if they knew who the driver was and they said yes, I demanded them for an explanation and the informed me that they were not able to reach the driver but not to worry because we were not charged for this order, I told him I was positive that their employee just stole food from us and us being charged was the least of my concerns and that us not being charged still wasn't sufficient enough considering we had people here expecting food and it's Friday night, not only that but this employee should not only be terminated but this is a serious offence, I was in the middle of sending a text when he said to me that I was no longer speaking to him and he was ending our chat- even though the 3 dots were up as I was tying. I have told everyone I know about this severe issue and I will not rest until it reaches the media. I have lost all of my faith in a company that stands behind employees and theft. I will personally never order with them again and I have spent over 200$ in the last 3 months with this company, being a 2.5 billion dollar company I know they do not care about that but they have lost a faithful customer who has a wide range of friends in South Florida. We are sick to our stomachs over this and I hope this employee is terminated if not prosecuted for this illegal activity.

"So let's get into the meat of this thing. The one pro I can say is that the app has range and most places are available for delivery. Even places that are pretty far which has allowed me to try a range of different places. Now onto the cons. Even as an UBER DIAMOND member costumer service is atrocious. For one they offer no real incentives to compensate for any food issues. The most they'll do is take a charge off an order (which it has limited parameters in which they are even willing to do that). Food is damaged or cold? They basically tell you deal with it. Food late or order canceled? Oh well! Once my food was delayed then canceled altogether (place was right around the corner btw) without so much as a notice (I only knew because I was monitoring the app) THEN they expected me to start a new order again on my own. I think this is some type of manipulative corporate tactic to avoid accountability and it's honestly disgusting. They EVEN placed the order under a COMPLETELY different date BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPORT INBOX IS MARKED FOR MAY. This has to be ILLEGAL! I can't make this up. Even if you're the most loyal and frequent customer they do little to NOTHING to ensure your happiness as a consumer. ANOTHER thing is the mystery that is the ""support inbox"". You have to go through hula hoops in navigating through the app to even FIND the inbox. Then sometimes you find it and the app closes the chat (even in some circumstances in which not much time has elapsed). Uber NEEDS to invest in better customer service especially considering the amount of individuals that are loyal to the app.

"My family has been ordering from UberEats for a number of years. We started using the food delivery service out of a need after an accident that resulted in disability (surgeries, rehab, etc.). We placed orders 4 to 5 times week. Over the years a number of issues with the delivery arose. Misdelivery (food ended up at the wrong address), wrong order delivered, missing items, spoiled food (resulting food poisening), horrible quality food, misrepresentation on the menu, cold food, sketchy drivers, etc. It is always a huge downer and really..., who wants to divert their energy to complain instead of enjoying the food or forcing yourself to eat whatever slob was delivered because you are HUNGRY. Complaints were not made lightly and alway legitimate.

On December 29,2022, we ordered from a restaurant we had ordered from one time prior. This time however, the food delivered had an obvious safety issue. As soon as I opened the door to receive the order, I smelled used/dirty motor oil. The outside of the bags was greasy and so was everything inside the bags including the glass drink bottles. All food items except for the pickles and spoonfull of coleslaw and cucumber smelled like dirty motor oil. We all sampled the food and spit it out. It tasted rancid, bitter and left our mouths burning even after rinsing our mouth with water repeatedly.

Naturally I reported it both on the order and in a chat. The BOT reply was a generic 'we appologize but can't do anything for you...' I called out the bot reply and apperently a human agent replied after a number of days. I replied and had to fend of the bot again. Finally an agent replied on January the 10th and admitted that there was an issue. He advised me to contact the escalation team. I asked how because there is no phone number or email listed on their website or found in Internet searches. It took several days before I was provided with a toll free phone number. I spoke with 2 agents today and got nowhere! Apparently Uber adopts a ZERO liability policy after their cut-off of an undisclosed number of complaints. All the agents kept repeating (like bots) is that my account is under 'review'... but that a $5.00 Uber credit was applied to my account... Is that compensation for the $70+ wasted and all the aggravation? Absolutely not! One thing is clear; Uber is by no means a reputable company. I had heard similar stories over the years and should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned...

"DO NOT EVER USE UBER EATS, AND TELL EVERYONE ELSE NOT TO AS WELL!

My last experience with Uber Eats support was horrendous. On March 26,2022, I ordered from Jersey Mikes. Uber Eats had a sitewide promotion for 25.00 of a 30.00 or more delivery order. Those were the only two criteria. Food total before tax and fees must be 30.00 dollars or more, and it must be a delivery, not a pickup. (photos attached)

Imagine my surprise when the full 47.22 is taken from my bank that night, instead of 22.22. Chatting with support at first went well. They agreed that the code did not ""automagically"" apply itself and issued a 25.00 refund, as opposed to a 25.00 credit.

Color me stupid when 48 hours later, no credit has been received by my bank. Contacting Uber Eats customer chat again, I asked about status of refund. The first chatter ended the chat, no response given. I was asked by the chat bot did they solve the problem? I select no. New chat agent appears. Says they will look into it. Tells me that the credit will be back in my bank in 3 to 5 business days. Why does it take that long in the days of digital banking? Every other service I use immediately credits my payment method back any confirmed errors. Why is it ok for Uber Eats to promise a credit, reflect it on your phone display in receipt form, then keep your money when they make a mistake? I cant order and pay 3 to 5 days later, so why are they allowed to steal my money?

"I was a loyal customer and I will say this has nothing to do with the hard working people who drive for this ""Company"". Long story short... I order pizza at 10:20 PM and was estimated to get it at 10:50 PM. I understand thats a soft time because they can never be exact. They changed to delivery time 3 different times now to 11:30 PM. I contacted UberEats chat and they offered to cancel my order but offered no other information. I said yes cancel my order and then they said ""Order cancelled, you will be charged a $17 fee"". During the chat and when they offered to cancel my order they never once said anything about a fee to cancel. I contacted them again and asked to be reimbursed because they are the ones who offered to cancel but never told me about a fee before i accepted plus they are the ones who did not have a driver available to pick up the food. They stated It was well within the estimated time frame and that they would not refund me. I asked to speak to a supervisor several times to which they refused and stated they can no longer help me and ended the chat. I started another chat and was lucky enough to get the same person by the name of Deepak. I stated that was unprofessional that he ended the chat and also for refusing to let me speak to a supervisor. I provided Deepak with screen shots of the chat and it clearly showed that they never once said anything about a a fee before THEY asked me if i wanted to cancel. Then I showed them another screen shot that clearly showed that my delivery time changed 3 different times which proves it was well over the time frame window which makes them response able for taking orders when they clearly know they dont have enough drivers in the area to meet the estimated time frame of delivery. Again he refused to let me speak to a supervisor until i threatened to post all screen shot of the messages and changed time frames to social media at which point (I assume) a supervisor entered the chat and finally gave me a refund. I had to spend more than an hour trying to get a refund for a problem that was clearly created by them. I WAS a a regular customer of uber eats but I can no longer support a ""company"" that makes it difficult for a customer to get a refund for a problem that they clearly made. I hate not to support the hard working uber drivers but I just can't support the greed this place showed me today.

"Working for Uber eats is terrible compared to doordash or any other service. They have problems accepting documents And they do not care about their employees. I had to drive a few miles to the restaurant after accepting a order I made it 5 min early upon arrival time. The store was already closed so they continue to give workers the same order and then they won't ever compensate you for your time for driving especially with gas prices right now. Doordash has no problem compensating their drivers for issues like this. I will no longer work for a company who doesn't care about their employees.

"Uber Eats sends scam email to the customers with 30% off if they spend $50.00 or more. If you don't use it they remind you it is about to expire. When you do use it the promo code doesn't apply. I contacted them and they profusely apologized and replied that there was a glitch in the system and I will be reimbursed and refunded on my credit card. This has happened several times. I placed an order tonight and no surprise the 30% promo code did not apply I contacted them and they now refuse to refund me because I have made many requests due to the fact that their promo code doesn't work I wouldn't have made those requests if the promo code had worked.

Here is their final response after several email exchanges.:

We're sorry for the inconvenience that this caused you, Susan. This is Chlerian, Manager from the Customer support team.
Thanks for letting us know about this. As I've checked the details, several orders have price adjustments or refunds. Because of this, we won't be able to provide you with a price adjustment on this order.
You can rate and leave feedback to your delivery person or merchant in the app. The feedback you've provided will help us work with the merchants and delivery people to improve the order experience.
We appreciate your patience and understanding. Sent by Chlerian on Tuesday, March 15,2022 at 1:55:45 AM

I also received once again an another email (attached) from Ubers Eats with a promo code of 30% off orders of $50 or more.

"UberEats has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

They continue to mess up their deliver orders; I constantly receive the wrong order.

I have photos to prove that the order was not mine.

When I speak with their agents over chat, they provide automated messages saying that they're ""looking into a resolution"".

I went through two ""chat agents"" since they abruptly cancel chats without a resolution, and the third agent that I try to get in touch with cancels the chat before even trying to help.

They refuse to provide me with a refund, because they say that I've complained about too many orders when in fact it's THEIR FAULT for not checking to ensure that the correct order is delivered.

I finally had to call them directly to complain in order to get a refund.

I want nothing to do with Uber at this time, and will be changing both deliver and transportation services.

Never doing business with UberEats again.

"I ordered food through the Uber Eat app and the rider (name Hafez Saleh) could not find the door to my apartment. I messaged him with instructions but was ignored, called him many time but couldn't hear him as the line was very bad, and suddenly got a message that the order has been delivered when it's not! When I contacted Uber Eat, they refuse to give me a refund as it was recorded as delivered. They blame me for not being attentive to the phone when I have clearly given the intructions and tried to contact the driver many times. They did not even bother to check the previous messages. I will report this incidence as a scam with my credit card and hopefully the transaction will be blocked. Its against customer rights to charge people with items they never received. For those who making orders, be very carefull as they will charge you regardless if you receive the item or not. Make sure to make screenshots of the messages as it will be deleted once the driver record it as delivered. The customer servive will not help you.

The driver left my order at some random door and sent a picture through the app (as attached), and uber eat asked me to pay for that and refused to give a refund!

"Uber Eats seems to want my business. They keep on waving free food deals in my face, like $20 free food, $25 free food and $35 free food.
Those are currently in my mailbox.

Problem is, the uber eats system didn't seem to like my perfectly valid visa card. I get to checkout, and uber tells me to select another method of payment. Like bloody hell am I entering a second card into a system that can't distinguish the first card!

As for customer service and help, they're as useless as a bucket without a bottom!

Too bad the uber system is so screwed up. I'd scarf up every one of those free food offers!

Too bad uber doesn't care enough to use trained CSRs and instead uber help is just a useless link to useless formulaic query--response listed by general topics and yes, you guessed, useless $#*!e.

"I wish I had seen this reviews before ordering from uber eats. I was not feeling well, caring for my husband with end stage liver cirrhosis and kidney failure. Had a guest visiting from out of town. So I thought let me order from Uber eat. I was so generous, also tipped 20% and paid extra for priority service. The food was diluvered to the wrong address, a picture of the food sitting in front of some house was sent to me. Tried connect to Mohammed the Uber eats delivery to say it was not my house. It was impossible to connect with him and impossible to connect with Uber eats app. It was dark and I am a 65 year old woman, went round the neighborhood to look fir the food to serve my guest and me. I was tired and unwell, and frustrated. I got in my car and went to pick food from my son's restaurant. They eventually refunded me in Uber cash, but they did not refund me the 20% tip. The Uber eat is a con business. Please please don't order from them. They are cunning and sky, I don't care, it is a $58 loss but I will never use that app. Just wanted to let you all know.

"I have been a loyal Uber Eats customer for some time now. I have not used their competitors. In the past, although there were often issues with deliveries the Uber Customer Service was excellent and they were quick to rectify any problems. Not any more. Recently I have had a couple of very botched orders, both of which Uber have refused to address. Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and the reason I will no longer use Uber deliveries moving forward.
I placed an order for a food delivery from MacDonalds. Three different Uber delivery drivers accepted the order and actually travelled to the restaurant (I watched each car travel to the store via the app tracking). But each time upon arriving at the restaurant the driver cancelled the job. I have no idea what was going on there. Finally, after the third driver cancelled and my delivery time jumped forward another hour I decided to cancel. I could not wait any longer. It had already been an hour as it was. There was no driver on the job at this time. Uber then proceeded to charge me for the entire order (including ""compensation for the delivery driver"", who never did the job and wasn't currently assigned!). I rang MacDonalds directly to check what was going on. They informed me my order had been sitting on their bench for an hour and no driver had been there. So I was forced to pack my two sick kids in the car and drive to the restaurant myself. I collected my cold, soggy ""hot"" cakes and hash brown and my cold, curdled coffee and returned home. The coffee was tipped down the sink and the inedible soggy food was also disposed of. This is not MacDonalds fault. But what in earth was Uber doing? I contacted Uber to ask for a refund of my $27 and they declined telling me "". Does not meet criteria for a refund based on the information I provided"". What doesn't meet their criteria? The customer having to drive down and collect the order themselves? Or the Uber incompetency where three seperate drivers failed to collect an order which was ultimately inedible. I'm furious to pay nearly $30 for this disgusting ""service"" and this is typical of Uber's business practice of late. Hence the reason I do not recommend Uber Eats and will be using Menu Log or Door Dash from now on.

Give Uber Eats a BIG miss! They charge for orders not delivered or inedible upon receipt after being left for hours. Despicable!

She talked with me for about 15 minutes to locate but after that she cancelled the order reporting that I changed the original location (which I never did) and Uber eats just charged me the full amount for the order stating that I changed the original delivery location which is what the driver might have reported. This is the same address I used with previous drivers and never got this problem I clearly got the hint from talking to the driver that she didn't want to come at my place because she wanted to keep the food and also make the money.

"Like many of the other reviews in here, I unfortunately had the experience of an Uber Eats driver claiming to have delivered the order, when they have not - absolutely despicable practices by some of their drivers who, when they have trouble finding the address, seem to call to say that they are reaching the address soon and to wait for them, and then never do, and Uber doing absolutely nothing to reprimate such dishonest drivers and to refund orders.

The Uber support service is also nothing more than a facade - when called, they just say to contact them by email, and then by email they simply respond with preformatted messages saying that they have no intention of doing anything about the problem.

I will not be using Uber Eats again (especially as there are plenty of better alternatives out there)

Uber eats has a promotion Spend $30, save $20. My order came to $31.
They didn't have some items so removed from my order, which brought me below the $30 so I lost the promotion.
I cancelled the order within 5 minutes.

Uber eats do not tell you that you won't receive a refund until AFTER you cancel your order.
Under terms and conditions they will give you 1 lifetime refund.

I contacted Uber eats and they advised they will not refund me as the merchant started the order.

I responded back with my situation and Uber eats have chosen to completely ignore me, even though they were happy to advise me within 10 minutes that they are keeping my money for an order I did not agree to, or received.

Uber eats conveniently post a phone number to contact them, however when you call they advise they are not taking phone calls.

"I am absolutely blow away at the dishonesty, disingenuousnesses and intentional price gouging (borderline theft) that Uber eats is doing to their customers and consumers.

My family was up charged $16.58 for pizza which sold at the store for a fraction of the price (I even checked the Papa Gino's website to verify in Bridgewater Mass, have the pictures but cannot upload due to space limitations on the site). $49.62 total for two large cheese pizza and one large pepperoni cost me $66.20 on my Uber eats bill at the hands of this thieving company. Not to mention the $9.00 dollar service fee which is added on for who knows what real reason (I'm assuming the owner enjoys taking advantage of family's and regular working people trying to get by in life) My family and I also provided a tip to the driver.

Disappointed is an under statement to say the least, it is an absolute atrocity, and this company should be put out of business. I'm sure the better business bureau is already aware, not to mention undercover stories from reputable national news networks looking to expose this fraud. I hope those who feel the same as I will band together with proof of price gouging for a class action lawsuit.

Absolutely ridiculous, I had a driver deliver to another place then stop in an apartment complex for 5-6 min. I LOVE the place I ordered from and wanted to complain about the driver and simply about the fact with delivering somewhere else first it caused my food to be cold and soggy.

Placed an order through the UE app, restaurant accepted, took payment and then cancelled my order minutes later keeping my money.
I only realised they hadn't automatically refunded me when payment came out of my bank 2 days later.
UE bluntly informed me I was too late in letting them know, as 48 hrs had passed, so no refund would even be considered! So even though I had the cancellation notice from the restaurant they still expected me to pay for an order, which is never cheap, that I didn't receive.
I asked them how to escalate it and they advised I couldn't, I just needed to accept I wouldn't get my money back. I've now gone through PayPal to hopefully reclaim through them.

So I contact Uber support, explained the situation. This was a $30 order and all the representative wanted to refund me back was $3.99. Losing my patience I threatened to report them to the FTC and have my bank reverse the charge. After all was said and done I ended up getting at least $28 excluding the tip.

I did the right thing and gave the order back so I don't understand why I was given such a hard time. This happened on another occasion, order was screwed up but I just counted the loss.

"Uber Eats continues to use a bait and switch tactic with its estimated wait times to lure customers into making an order. Then, when you place the order, the wait time significantly increases. Of course that's annoying, but when you try to cancel the order because it's going to take 20-40 minutes longer than advertised, they won't let you without a cancelation fee. The customer service rep told me they would charge me $15 to cancel a $20 order. How is this even legal? Is false advertisement and entrapment. How long until they have a huge lawsuit on their hands?

"This company takes every possible scammer tactic in they could possibly think of and applies it to their customers. Lets start with some examples of how these scammers, scam their customers.

1. Fake promotions:
Ever get a push notification from uber with something like 75% off your next order or $25 off your next order ect? Of course you have! Now how many times when you clicked on that notification did you actually receive that offer? For me its never. It is simply a scam they do to get you back on the app. To convince you to just order something because your already there. Not only do they do this via push notifications they constantly spam you with similar emails. Again none of these promotions are real they are just false advertising to get you back on the app in hopes you buy something anyway.
2. Credit/Refunds:
Ever notice after complaining about an order the ""Credit"" they applied to your account never actually applied? Even if you received a notification saying it has been applied? This is no accident. They are hoping you don't notice on your next order that nothing was applied and just assume it was. This way they keep all their cash and you made another order through the app thinking you were getting a discount for them screwing something up.
3. ""Customer Support""
Lets say they screw something up that is worth more than $5 or there is some issue you have that requires human interaction. Good luck finding the right combination of options to actually chat with a person and if somehow you manager to get into a chat your still not going to reach a human being. What happens is they always have a line of 10+ people you wait in the que for 20-30 minutes then they tell you sorry they couldn't reach you in time we'll contact you via email. There is no option to opt out no way to continue waiting. This happens every single time. So essentially their chat system is a glorified email ticket system except you have to wait 20-30 minutes to submit the ticket. What about a 1800 number you ask? Oh they have one, And it tells you they don't offer phone support and tells you to use the app. So in other words completely worthless.
4. Jacking up the prices:
They jack up the prices on everything in addition to their insane fees. You'd think the $5+ in fees and $5+ tip would be the end of the money you are charged to order through these scammers but you'd be wrong. All menu item prices are drastically increased. Seriously Look at the uber prices and compare at the actual restaurant. A $2 sandwich becomes a $3.20 Sandwich ect

Don't

"Ordered Taco Bell and sidelines two nights in a row. Delivery time was delayed multiple times each order. Called sidelines tonight they said our food is ready and been sitting there for over an hour not yet picked up. Just had a baby and I am unable to drive. The orders on both nights ended up never being delivered and cancelled without any warning. Restaurant explained to me if no drivers are in the area then your order will never be delivered despite the restaurant making our order right on time. This is unfair to costumers and also the establishment. On both ends we are left with food that wasn't picked up nor delivered. Uber eats does not need to lead people to believe food is coming that will never arrive. U have to wait days for a refund to return to your card and u have no meal after hours of waiting.

"I've used Uber for trips a lot in the past, though I've had problems with those, too, just not related to the service--only a few of the drivers. Trying Uber Eats, I thought it couldn't be that different than any other delivery service. I was very, very wrong. I signed up for Uber Eats Pass, thinking I could save some money. My first order was fine... until I realized they charged me a ""subtotal adjustment"" of $18.19 on a $37.80 order. I couldn't believe it. Nothing in my order was changed, so that couldn't explain the charge. There's no way to contact customer service, which means they have no customer service. You have to use the ""Help"" in the app, but what good is that when we're talking about food delivery? If there's an issue, you need help right away, not hours or days after your order. I had to wait until the following day to get a response, and then the response was: Can you please provide details? Which tells me their pathetic app can't even link to the order. So I did. I waited several more hours. In the reply I received, no explanation was provided except something to the effect of ""these things happen sometimes,"" no refund was offered, and then the ""priority support"" agent had the gall to thank me for being a Gold member. Well, here's the thing: I'm no longer a Gold member. I immediately deleted my Uber account and filed a complaint with the BBB for my refund. Although there aren't a lot of choices with ride share services, I'll take my chances with Lyft. Maybe Lyft will actually bother to treat me like they value my patronage. P.S. I didn't even get my 5% discount, which I was supposed to receive for signing up with Uber Eats Pass. How pathetic is that?
Tip for consumers:
Don't bother with Uber Eats. The drivers don't care. Uber certainly doesn't care, or they'd provide you with a customer service phone number so you could resolve issues promptly. Uber is also too greedy to give you a refund for anything for any reason, even when the problem is their fault.

"Order arrived late and very cold via Uber Eats. Item completely missing as well. Total waste of money, most items went right in the trash. I paid about $52.00 for this?! Went on the Uber Eats app to file a complaint, they sent me an auto message saying they credited my Uber Eats acct for 10 dollars. So 42 dollars for completely cold food that we tossed and a missing item that costs about 5 dollars on the Uber Eats app from Wendys. Big disappointment and we are still hungry! Obviously we do not consider this anywhere close to decent service by Uber Eats.

I called customer service to cancel my order since it was already late and while they cancelled it, I was still charged for the order. I'm being made to pay for Uber Eats mistake. They should pay the restaurant for the order, it wasn't the restaurant's fault nor, was it my family's fault - yet I'm the one being punished.

Half of the times I used Uber Eats I always had to report to customer service because of issues with timing.

"I made a purchase on 8/10/2023. The store had a promo and gave a discount of $7.23
However I was charged the full amount. I went online to chat to get this corrected. After a lengthy chat I was told that since I waited over 48 hours to alert them, there was nothing they could do and ""thanked me for my understanding"" and ended the chat. There is no phone number to call that will allow me to speak with a human to resolve this. I am canceling my Uber One and going to another restaurant delivery service.

"UberEats' Customer ""Service"" department must be trained to lie and stall and delay and fabricate excuses. Because that's what they do. Not just inept, which can happen with Customer Service, but them actually lying through their teeth. You cannot trust them. They spout a barrage of scripted excuses that don't even align with each other (refund 'delayed' a month due to ""an outage"", then ""tech issues"", THEN they say their ""special escalation team"" is ""looking into the refund"" to ""resolve""). And even when you simply have a question you want answered, not an order issue or problem but just seeking some basic information about a promo or whatever, their replies are a bottomless pit of them not even reading the question and just punching some automated reply that has nothing to do with the question at all. So UberEats is not worth it. None of the delivery services are perfect but at least the others I've used don't seem to be raging liars and thieves, as Uber Eats support is trained to be. Stay away from UberEats if you value your peace of mind; their Customer ""Service"" (""Support"") is a hellhole of stupidity and lies. (Doordash has been pretty good so far, some slight customer service ineptness one time but at least they're not outright cheating their customers as UberEats does on the regular).

"Traveling in Houston Friday, we used Uber Eats to deliver some Asian food. My wife tips $10 on the $76 check and hurried back to the room to see why the bill was so high.
The charge us $4 ea for two drinks that were not delivered. When my wife ordered three spring rolls nobody asked ""three orders?"" Or ""total of three?"" Nope, they didn't think it was odd for an order with only two entries to get 12 spring rolls, or they just were happier with increasing the amount of the sell. It's dishonest and wrong.
They also didn't think we'd maybe need a paper plate or plastic ware with our delivery location being a hotel? If it were my restaurant, my employees would be trained to ask things like: 'do you need plates, napkins and utensils?' Or 'each spring roll comes with a total of four, did you want 3, or 12?' Things like this are for the benefit of the customer. This joint did nothing like that. The Spicy Chen Asian Bistro will take advantage of you and send you food you don't need and short you on drinks your ordered. Then Uber Eats will REFUSE to credit your bill for the things you didn't receive! The representative is rude and arrogant. I will never consider using Uber Eats again and I warn you all about Spicy Chen Asian Bistro food is over the top salty and my chicken fried rice was awful. Many uncooked grains of rice and skinny little pieces of chicken that tasted more like eating a sun dried clam. It wasn't good and they do not care that the order was bad, after all we are only traveling, right? They don't know all my HS friends live nearby that hotel. They won't order from Spicy Chen Asian Bistro knowing that anything might, or might not, show up.
And to Jenn at Uber: a different line of work would be good for you because rude arrogant people are not helpful and make the situation worse that it already was. They actually damage the companies they work for. The lowest employees with such abundant arrogance? Hmmm. This is only 1 of 14 sites I am posting this review to. I made them a promise that I'd spread the news about this experience and she said go ahead, it won't matter to anybody. Order this duo at your own risk.
My son who is college out of state read my review and said ""Uber Eats never gets it right dad!"".
Tip for consumers:
Find another Asian Restaurant. If you do order expect hard chicken cooked until grainy and greasy limp cold food by the time they deliver. They guarantee food is on time or free deliveries for three months. They give selves 69 minutes to deliver!! How’re ever late. In addition the food is cold, but it’s “on time” according to Uber. Guarantees mean nothing if you change the definition to one that is nowhere near accepted definition for that service. Worst service and rude support.
Products used:
Chicken Fried Rice, General Chows Chicken 3 pieces (not orders) spring roll. Food was cold and limp from grease. We were given drinks we paid $9 for and idiot taking order for two entrees didn’t think to ask if we meant 3 spring rolls or 3 full orders? So they got $12 on spring rolls, $9 beverages and $9 tip that they didn’t earn. $30 is allot to me and they refuse to make it right.

"I am upset for the umpteenth time with Uber Eats. I requested an order and they continuously pushed my delivery time back. And then when I canceled the order after it's been pushed back numerous times, I was still charged. Who in the hell wants cold food?

"Ordered food. Uber driver said it was delivered, it WAS NOT. Called driver and he said must have delivered to wrong address. By the time Uber driver came back I tracked my food down which was a totally different floor. Uber driver physically handed my order to someone else and they accepted order. Called customer service fir Uber, they were not helpful. Use Doordash, they are much better!

"Uber used to be a an asset, not a liability (blessing not a curse). These days … wow! Out of the past 7 orders … they have cheated me, lied, didn't deliver, but made certain to charge me — then had the audacity to tell me that my delivery was not eligible for refund. Suck it up. I have had the fight to have any type of compensation.

Today, I tried redeeming their offer of a 75% off Uber cash. Once again, I am being lied to, treated out of my order. If I could sue Uber over the frustration, anger, loss of many dollars, and time, I would. Today, Mark, the end of my relationship with Uber. Even if you had the best luck in the world, you would not be able to engage them directly.

"I bought Microsoft 365, and with it I got 6-months of free delivery and a $20 credit from Uber Eats. I installed the app. The first time I tried to use it, I got a message saying my payment method was invalid. I tried 3 different cards (all with plenty of money), and I got the same message each time. I figured something was wrong with the app and used GrubHub instead. A week later, I tried Uber Eats again and got the same message. I emailed support to find out if the problem could be corrected, but instead I got a message saying my account was restricted because I was not complying with Uber's terms and conditions. I emailed back and asked how that was possible given that all I did was try to order food through the app. I got another message back saying that a review showed ""irregular activities"" on my account and that Uber has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud. Apparently, attempting to order food from a restaurant on their platform with my bank card is suspicious. Btw, based on the language in the emails, I am guessing I am getting automated responses. What the heck? My initial email says that my account is restricted until further notice. I wonder if that restriction will lift when my free delivery period is up!

Never mind, Uber. I've survived this long without you, and (other than the frustration) it's no skin off my back. You, however, have lost what would have been an excellent customer. Oh, and your app continues to send me messages to encourage me to use my $20 credit. Really?!?!

"At first, I had a few minor issues with my orders and let Uber Eats know about it. Never asked for a refund or anything back, just wanted to let them know the issues so they could improve. Because they willingly, without me asking, gave me refunds for no reason, I am now dealing with needing a refund and being refused to get one because THEY chose to give refunds over minor things. I ordered from Moe's in Spartanburg, SC and received the wrong order. The receipts I had showed someone else's name and order. The restaurant blamed the delivery driver for picking up the wrong order from the restaurant and Uber Eats refused to do anything about it. The wrong order that I received cost half of the order that I placed and paid for. My child was also allergic to ingredients in the order I received, but again, nothing could be done. Thank God I am very observant when it comes to our food and check it before anyone eats it. This company doesn't care about their customers. They do not care when an order is wrong. They do not care that the wrong order could have harmed someone, even a child, physically. They do not care that you paid extra and received the wrong order. They will not do anything about it. This company SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.

"It's very frustrating reading reviews saying uber is terrible and their drivers are thieves and orders take hours to get there.
First and foremost you can't put all drivers into a thief category. I personally never have and never will still someone's food. And for it taking so long to get there, ok but where do you live? How far are they driving? I deliver around Austin and sometimes i get an order 20 miles outside of town, well by the time I fight traffic then drive all that way it's 40 minutes. Ok well I just got paid $5.00 by uber to drive 40 minutes after how ever long it took me to get to whatever restaurant to pick it up. Then you ordered ice cream or a shake and guess what happens in 100 degree weather? It's now melted and your food is not as hot as it should be. So now you tip a dollar or even two because you're pissed that you ordered so far away and you give the driver a thumbs down because of something that's ultimately just as much your fault as ubers. So the driver now is losing money because once they start getting thumbs down they start losing money through uber. So why is uber service so bad you ask? Because you all have made it this way. These people don't make it on what uber pays. They make it on your tips so the good drivers leave and go deliver for someone else where they get better tips. Trust me these drivers aren't drivers around with your food in your car they're trying to get rid of it and get on another delivery. So there for if you have a time problem with uber that's exactly what it is with uber not the driver! Whatever though keep on big spending and tipping your $1.00 and wonder why your drivers suck. Um because you get what you pay for and what you've all built. How about give the actual good drivers like me I might add some praise instead of bashing all of us! Oh and by the way keep your $1.00 tip and give a thumbs up it costs you nothing and I don't lose money or even possibly lose my driving privileges

"I stopped using Ubereats months ago because even though we were using them 4+ times per week all Quarantine, we started getting food 30-60minutes LATER than expected. Regularly. OR Ubereats cancelled the order for no reason without telling us, until my kids were starving…never apologizing or giving refunds. Infact, TONIGHT we got a ""Ubereats cancelled your order, no refund because it was too late"".?! How can it be too late for a refund if I didn't cancel? Then I realized they SHADILY did this so I couldn't leave a review. We only used Ubereats because I got a 40% off email. I ordered TGIFridays. It took over an hour, Ubereats had apparently ""cancelled"" our order, but still charged us AND still sent the food? The food was over cooked yet still stone cold? My steak was supposed to be medium, it was Over well. Everything else was cold and our drinks had clearly been spilled as the small cups were only about 25% full at most. So shady. I will never be fooled again. Back to Doordash. Ubereats has clearly figured out a way around good quality and service…you can't even complain on their site if they pretend to ""cancel"" you, while still charging you. SHADY

"I made an order through their website to send some food to a person who had come down with covid and their family could use some dinner. The Money was debited from my account and of course the food never showed up. When I called the customer service number it said the number was shut down until further notice. So now the money is out of my account and the family didn't have the food. I can't use the money to go buy other food because it is already out of my account. I know that it may come back in a couple of days but it does me no good right now. I was also never notified that the food wasn't delivered. What a horrible experience. Do not use this company. You will be better served to forage in the woods or use a different company. They really need a legitimate customer service number! The fact that they get one star is a joke. They shouldn't get any stars.
Tip for consumers:
Don't use Uber Eats. That's the best tip I can give. You may have money debited from your account and not have any food. They will not notify you that the order isn't coming and there is no legitimate customer service number to call to help straighten things out. I would think there would have to be some laws concerning this so that people conduct fair business, but I guess not.

I placed an order for pizza, saw that my order was picked up and on its way, then all of a sudden it was canceled. Driver said that I canceled it, but that is a lie. He picked up my pizza, then canceled my order and kept the free food for himself. I tried to contact him but his voicemail was full (go figure) so I sent him a text asking about my order to which he replied ""umm... I think you have the wrong number lady!"" Well, he wouldn't know my gender had he not actually been my delivery person, so no, I did not have the wrong number. I contacted the restaurant to let them know that Uber Eats is stealing from them, and ruining experiences for their customers.

"Because of a financial emergency, I needed to earn some extra money quickly.
I made the mistake of signing up for Uber Eats as a driver. This was to be for two weeks. Upon signing up, getting my background check approved, and providing all relevant documentation, my account was flagged for 'fraudulent activity'. The reason - while playing around with the App, I had 'declined' multiple offered trips. I was simply investigating the delivery transaction volume, with no intention to drive. Uber Eats, for some reason, associates declined delivering offerings with fraud? For the 20+ deliveries that I did make, I received a 100% customer approval rating, and was designated as a 5* of 5* delivery driver. Uber indicated to me that this 5* customer approval rating WAS NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM. What really mattered to them, was that I accepted every delivery offer presented to me, even if I was in the middle of making 2 deliveries that I had already accepted previously. This is the order 'Acceptance Rating'. That's really what mattered to them. So there you have it, from Uber's own mouth - their customers' approval ratings regarding actual deliveries DON'T MATTER. This is how stupid and irrational these people are. No surprise they are ranked at the BOTTOM of driving organizations. And, not surprisingly, the idiot who created this organization, T Kalanick, netted $3 billion from his Uber stock sales. A world 'gone mad'.

Immediately contacted driver who acted like he couldn't understand English when he spoke perfect English at my front door. It wasn't until my husband got on the phone with him that he said to text him our problem because he was driving to make another delivery when he should have turned around and delivered the other bag to us. Customer support was terrible all they did was give us a credit for the food we didn't receive when I wanted to take the guys tip of way. I gave the guy $10 and he didn't perform the job he was supposed to but customer support wouldn't let me. I feel you Ubereats should have eaten the $10 then.

"I have had several aspects of order or COMPLETE orders costing $50-70 that have not been delivered since pandemic began. When this happens, support at uber BELIEVES THE PAYING CUSTOMER LESS. If one driver steals your food, you will not easily be believed or refunded and they will tell you it is because you have requested a refund and price adjustment BEFORE. Um, yes, because you are all incompetent, greedy THIEVES! How is that my problem? I trusted them with my money and they did not deliver (literally) and they have the audacity to be this huge, rich corporation literally STEALING MONEY from hardworking people. Both times my entire order was stolen, uber could have EASILY made one phone call to discover the issue was not with me and valid issues. One time was a driver who lied about being bike delivery on the platform, I was their second order, and I screenshotted the GPS on the app showing the ""biker"" going 10 miles away on the expressway in the OPPOSITE direction. I also tried calling the ""driver"" and it was a number from a disconnected ""Text Now"" texting app. Total scam partner and if uber didn't believe me, totally fine, it took ONE PHONE CALL or ONE MINUTE reviewing the partner's GPS/location in the app-they were NEVER even near my address. I was out $70 no refund because I had been stolen from before using their shady app where anyone can just sign up with a FAKE NUMBER and steal food and CUSTOMER must pay to support this scam artist?! SHAME ON UBER, A MULTI MILLION COMPANY. Uber is a company worth nearly $70 billion and they cannot even be bothered to spend less than five minutes looking into why a hard working therapist, who has been a loyal customer for over 10 years, was STOLEN FROM? Tried them again last night, and I knew there would be an issue when the app claimed yet another scam artist delivery partner (also a biker who arrived in a vehicle and had horrifying ratings from other hard-working, PAYING, LOYAL customers. Said the ""biker"" tried to call me, which she of course never did, so I immediately tried calling, messaging, and finding her and my order, and of course screenshotting EVERYTHING since uber has already called me a liar. Well, I ordered $50 worth of food and received about $13 of it. The bag was tampered with. I sent uber pictures, screenshots, EVERYTHING. I even called the restaurant, who knew what had occurred, admitted fault, AND TRIED TO CONTACT UBER TO RESOLVE AND FIX IT. The restaurant could not reach uber to resolve and offered to provide me with a free meal. I have filled out every uber form, called EVERY number, and spoken with the GM of the restaurant, and they refuse to refund me via uber app and have STOLEN MONEY FROM ME YET AGAIN. They refuse to believe you if you have had a problem with missing items or missing orders before. They don't vet these thieves. Uber support is a joke and Uber is a corporation who is worth nearly $70 billion and steals from hard-working therapists and loses years-long paying loyal customers over less than $100. In both theft situations, uber could have made ONE phone call and gotten to the bottom of it in both cases. Instead of spending 30 seconds making ONE phone call, they decided to call me a liar repeatedly and refuse to refund me less than $100 and just look into the issues. The customer service is abhorrent, as is the entire greedy disgusting company. I deleted the app after 17 hours of trying to get ANYONE to help and support me and force them to look into it. I am a paying, loyal customer and have been for many years--I will NEVER give uber my money and neither will my family. I will only use grubhub, doordash, postmates, and lyft now.

"My order came later because the delivery time changed once. My first driver when close to the restaurant, drove away and drove further into another city. THEY cancelled. As frustrated as I was now the time getting closer and closer to the delivery time, I tried to cancel the order and it said the cancel fee was $18. Called the help number then by the time I was going to cancel another driver picked up the order and was on its way. Uber still ended up giving me $4 back for a $30 order.

Now my food is cold and it is stale at that. Doesn't make it any better than the delivery service was very unprofessional, not punctual and there was no communication between the drivers and I.

Was NOT the first time the first DRIVER who CHOOSE to TAKE ON the order cancelled and drove around aimlessly.

Not only is it unacceptable that I as a customer has to go through this - the second driver always magically appears to deliver the food just a minute before the delivery time. So in that way I still got what I wanted? Yet the other time this happened to me a few weeks ago, the driver kept switching and cancelling AND the delivery time kept getting pushed back and even more and more delayed.

First driver might as well drive along the whole country.

"Completley disgusted, I received a coupon for $25 off my first order so I decided to try Uber Eats. I received a call 25 minutes which went into my VM saying they cancelled my order & gave me no reason why. I then went to my bank account & noticed they charged me still for the amount minus the delivery tip i left? Is this what happens when have a coupon & you dont want to honor it. This is disgusting that Uber Eats would cancel my order with no reason givin then take my money> this is disgusting to say the least & I am left with no lunch today. So Uber Eats is a scam as far as Im concerned, dont believe in any BS emails you received with coupons. I truly believe this was canceled because whoever didnt want to honor the credit that was offered. I never received confirmation either, even 20 minutes after i ordered, just the cancellation VM left where my phone did not even ring for me to answer the call. All the while the page i was on said Michael is picking up my order at the restaurant, it kept tracking all the way until i contacted them about the VM. THEN everything disappeared- the entire order but they were able to keep my cc info on file. DISGUSTING! I have contacted the BBB & my bank for unauthorized charges. I did not authorize you to cancel my order then charge me for nothing! Your customer service is pathetic!
Tip for consumers:
Dont trust Uber Eats & especially don't trust emails with coupons or deductions to your meals. They dont honor them. They will cancel your order & give no reason then charge you anyways!

"I shared the following Google review with a restaurant---YUP DDUK LA in Koreatown Los Angeles---that uses the unreliable delivery service, Postmates (who apparently merged with Ubereats):

""About 2 Hours Later: Food Wasn't Delivered, Unhelpful Customer Service, But Credit Card Charged.""

This is the title of the following 1 star, negative review I shared via Sitejabber (about Postmates/Ubereats, this restaurant's delivery folks, who already have a 1 star rating via both: Sitejabber for 713 Postmates reviews, and Trustpilot for 2,800 Postmates reviews + 25,000 plus UberEATS reviews):

YUP DDUK LA [...] is only a 2 minute drive from my hotel. However, since [...], I decided to order delivery.

Almost two hours later, I received a call from a guy stating that he had arrived at my hotel; so I told him I'll be right there, and rushed down.

I went outside the hotel and checked out several cars parked in front of the hotel---and even asked a few people in their vehicles if they were Uber drivers (but they weren't).

I then called the unknown, Uber guy's phone number back, but an automated message said that I wasn't able to complete the call.

I then looked around the hotel parking lot and nearby areas, but didn't see anyone there either.

So I returned to my hotel room and contacted Postmates, and spoke with Jay (with an Indian accent).

He asked, so I gave him the very long, order confirmation number (that I took a screenshot of, thankfully, among other proof of purchase, to include the last four of my credit card number that I used for this order).

But after putting me on hold for a minute or so, and talking to his Supervisor, Jay then told me that they had recently merged with Ubereats, hence, I needed to contact them.

However, my attempt to contact Ubereats was unsuccessful since 1) an automated message stated that they don't take phone calls now, and 2) since they suggested I receive help via an Ubereats account, I created one, only to find out that they have no record of my order (though Jay from Postmates said that they merged, and for me to contact Ubereats).

What a vicious circle this is!

I then contacted the restaurant (mentioned above), but this snappy, unhelpful, young woman stated that there was no order placed under my full name and/or my phone number.

She also added that they're not responsible for what their delivery people do (i. E., there's a blue tab that you click on titled, ""ORDER DELIVERY"" by Postmates, right below the business name, YUP DDUK LA, and their Google reviews).

Later tonight (6/4/2021), I received a 'no reply' email from Postmates apologizing for overcharging me (and that it would be corrected), and then stating that my order was successfully delivered.

But of course, since I haven't been able to contact Ubereats---the goto customer service now according to Postmates---I wasn't able to inform them that I didn't receive my order.

I called my credit card bank to block the charge from them; but they have to wait until the pending turns into a post in order to dispute.

I wonder if both Postmates and Ubereats are completely aware of this, and using this to their advantage.

I also wondered how many other Souls they screwed over; and sure enough, I came upon online sites such as Sitejabber [AND Trustpilot], that reveals the truth of the many.

Well, if this is the type of non-beneficial, negative, fear-based energy that these companies want to dish out, I have no doubt that humanity in general will become a COLLECTIVE WITNESS to their INEVITABLE DOWNFALL in Divine perfect timing and order, along with ALL other questionable, shady, dishonest, deceptive, misleading, and/or corrupt companies who mistakenly think they're so clever at taking advantage of others, not realizing at a profound Soul level, that ALL of Life throughout this world and beyond is energetically interconnected.

Tip for consumers:

There seems to be an abundance of collective proof from many people [one example: a 1 star rating via Sitejabber for 713 reviews] that Postmates [delivery service] are not trustworthy, reliable, [and] professional, AND they're not willing to take responsibility for very poor service.
Tip for consumers:
Let's be wise and discerning, and do our best NOT to fall for such companies who have had a long, pattern of NOT being honest, professional, reliable, responsible, and trustworthy.

"8:56am - Place Uber Eats Order, charged $80.98.

8:58am - Receive notification of cancelled order due to restaurant closed and I will receive a refund for the $80.98 in 3-5 business days.

9:00am - Place a new Uber Eats order, charged $79.47 with ETA no later than 10:20am.

10:10am - Check my phone to see status of order and it shows delivered at 9:55am. I check my front porch and there is nothing there.

10:20am - I contact an Uber rep via the help chat to see where my order is. After another 10 minutes of waiting I am advised that they could not get in touch with the driver to find out what happened but they will issue a refund for the $79.47 to be received in 3-5 days.

I now have $160.45 in charges that I am waiting for refunds on and running low on spending funds until payday tomorrow. I ask the rep if he can not issue the $79.47 refund and instead just get my food re-ordered and delivered. He advises me he cannot and if I want my food, I have to place and pay for yet another order and wait at least another hour. I explain that I do not have the funds in my account since I am waiting for $160.45 in refunds but he advises he cannot do anything and abruptly ends the chat at 10:43am.

10:45am - My husband begins to contact some neighbors who were doing some gardening outside to see if they may have seen any Uber deliveries or other activity to help us solve this issue. After a few discussions with other neighbors, it is discovered that a neighbor three doors down received our order. That neighbor contacted Uber to find out about the mysterious order and why they got it and they asked if it might belong to another neighbor. The Uber contact they spoke to said that it was an error and that they could have it if they wanted it or just throw it away. They said if anyone in the neighborhood reports a missing order, they would just replace and re-deliver it. So our neighbors proceeded to eat the order.

10:56am - I attempt to contact Uber help again to give them this newly discovered feedback and I receive an auto response that since I have already been issued a refund for my order, that I can no longer contact them regarding this order issue.

Now 2 hours later, I have no order, no refund for 3-5 days, no re-order from Uber as they advised my neighbor, and no ability to re-order myself since I do not have enough spending funds in my account as I wait for $160.45 to be refunded.

And to top things off, I have no way to contact Uber to give them this disappointing feedback as they are not taking support calls at this time and they refer you only to their Help section of the app where they proceed to tell you they can't help you since you've already received a refund... FRUSTRATING!

"First issue...I went on Uber Eats to order from Chipotle, I saw what the total would be (expensive) so I never completed it and closed the page. I then placed an order for Taco Bell it hadn't showed up so I called the driver/deliverer he said that he was not my driver. I searched for a # to call (impossible) I finally found the option for help and reported that I had not received my order. They replied by sending a picture of where they dropped off my food, behind my house! It had been sitting out there in the rain for 40 mins because I never even received a message that it was dropped off... So...on top of it being wet and cold the order was wrong. I called Taco Bell and they said I had to take it up with Uber Eats...Uber Eats messaged me back and said to write a review on Taco Bell's website. Then I decided to use Door Dash and ordered from Chipotle even tho they were more expensive, they delivered the food no problems but I noticed another wet bag of food from Chipotle that Uber Eats left (The order that I never actually placed) I ended up spending $80 for one burrito bowl that door dash delivered. Uber Eats said that I was not due a refund since the food was dropped off at the right address...even tho they left it behind my house in the rain and never notified me it was dropped off.

"BEWARE UBEREATS IS A SCAM! I ordered food from a restaurant ""Mexican Grille"" on Ubereats at 11:38pm. It was to arrive within 60-80mins, however, after waiting for 110mins, i tried to contact the restaurant, only to find on google that the restaurant had been closed the whole time. No food was delivered, yet i was CHARGED BY UBER EATS FOR A MEAL NOT DELIVERED. I thereafter sent multiple messages to ubereat, no response, no refund. Tried calling them, phone lines are only available to ongoing orders. It's now been some days, still no response. What becomes immediately obvious is that

1)In comparison to deliveroo which offers swift support to its customers, Ubereats does not care about you beyond getting you to part with your money. It has an unreliable customer service when you do have issues. And surely having an order related issue is only a matter of time.

2)Mexican Grille is not even available in my town. Yet Ubereats listed the restaurant as if it was in my region and allowed customers to place orders, only for us to not receive any meals, yet be charged. They are running a scam model here.

3) Save your money, Ubereats is poor in doing its due diligence, has unresponsive customer service to address ongoing disputes. Supposedly listed a restaurant, yet was unaware that its phone lines do not even work. As a customer save your hard earned money, if you lose it, you will have only yourself to blame like me.

I am so used to Deliveroo's (another food delivery company) reliable customer service, this is a shame on Ubereats.

P. s-It's been two days later, no customer service response to my complaints, no meal delivered and no refund. BEWARE EVERYONE OF UBER EATS it could be you tomorrow.

"Simply not worth it. I continuously get bad food, missed items, or bad delivery drivers. Recently I had a HORRIBLE order that I asked for a refund on. It was burnt, the food was cold, my burger was somehow watery, and I ended up throwing it away. I waited an hour. They refused a refund, and gave me the same automated response. Delivery fees are also very high. Use Grubhub or Doordash. Uber Eats is not worth all of the headaches just to order food.

"BUYER BEWARE ""UBEREATS"" IS AN EXTREMELY TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE

Not impressed. In a nutshell I have used this service twice! The 1st time nothing to complain about! However this past week I used the service again, BIG mistake. Although the driver was friendly & I tipped him (with note I would do so myself) an hour after the delivery they decided to take another $2.08 from my card. And notified me of this through email. An email that you cannot reply to. Comes back DAMON FAILURE. It's about the principle. Well if that were not bad enough I have wrote them now 3 times regarding my order! Although the bag came with stickers that said
Checked for accuracy (yes)
Check by (empty)
My dessert was not in bag, hence 1st email. Then I realized although my salad was in bag the dressing was not the one I ordered so I messaged again, as I dont want dry salad. Regardless u can't reply to emails they send. They say via their app customer support will get back to you within 24hrs, LIES it has been over 84 hours now. No response! They have my info, they have my # they could have called or the restaurant could have to say would you like a different dessert if they were out / or chose to simply not bother to give me my pie. At same time they could have asked me to choose a different dressing if they did not have one I asked for! Is it Ubereats or the restaurant to blame? You tell me? They have agreed to work together I say they are equally to blame but moreso Ubereats as they are the ones I paid. At the end of the day I have a rotton salad that i paid for & a pie that I paid for that I did not receive. Again principle its not the 2.86 (salad) 1.29 (pie) 2.08 (tip they had no right forwarding in regards to my note that I WOULD TIP DRIVER MYSELF AND DID). Ahmad was a nice guy! It is that I do not and should not be charged for their screw ups (meaning Ubereats as they r the ones that took my $) They are the ones that have not got back to me that I am aware of. I dont mind the jacked up prices and delivery fees PROVIDING THEY GIVE ME WHAT I PAYED FOR!
Really choked at this company I will not be using their services again! Nor do I recommend anyone else go through the hassle that I did & still am!
My summary of gatger thoughts as follows...
- TOTALLY Disrespectful %!
- NOT Courteous!
- TAKE $ THEY DIDN'T EARN!
~ABSOLUTELY NON RESPONSIVE TO YOUR COMMENTS, COMMUNICATION, EMAILS, MESSAGE ATTEMPTS

The Customer service representatives all use that cheap $#*! psychological deterence method by oh we will not or cannot compensate you nor give any coupons but will make note of it in the system, we take our customer feedbacks seriously.

"I switched to Uber Eats because both Doordash and Grubhub have screwed me over before.
So far, things have been okay with them- but holy crap their customer service is full of morons.
I asked a simple website question- where is the option to choose tip amount?- because I had placed an order, wasn't given the option to input tip, and then charged and extra $10 on a $22 order.
They said they couldn't help me without logging into the email associated with the account. I just want to know if we can pick tips or if they changed that, and they will NOT answer me. The fact they can't answer a simple question is beyond ridiculous, especially one that involves more money for them. Shady as hell, the company sucks.

"Ordered aome Italian, received the pizza which I couldn't eat, almost got sick, called the restaurant and explained the issue. They offered a full refund and said will notify ubereats about having me reimbursed.
Few weeks later I go and check my bank acc balance, no refund appears. I email the restaurant again, they call me claiming they askes ubereats to refund on the day of the order. I send ubereats a long message with all the dates/detailed info. They reply claiming no such request was ever made by the restaurant, nor will they refund me because that's against the policy (!?). I send them a screenshot of an email fr the restaurant owner/manager where he clearly states he is happy to refund me, howevee ubereats claim they will not, constantly mentioning their policy. I sent over FIFTEEN messages basically repeating myself like a damn parrot, re explaining everything. I asked ubeats which part of their policy allows them to charge me for food I didn't even eat, have a restaurant approve the refund and them still won't giving my money back. No reasonable explanation was ever given, nor did I see my money back.

They stole it as far as I'm concerned!

I then go and google ubeats reviews and discover how many people they've robbed. I'm attaching a tiny percentage of thise reviews.

Their so called customer service is full of high school drop outs, which is great to see that even those types manage to get a job, however having to read their idiotic emails full of excuses and general BS makes me want to throw my phone at a wall. They take people's money and won't refund them even when the driver decides to not show up and claim whoever ordered the food never opened the door! I even found comments left my ubereats drivers bragging about how they get fes up with not receiving tips and keep the food for themselves especially on a nice sunny day from a good restaurant.

"I received a $25 gift card with Uber Eats so thought I would try the service for the first time. I put in an order for a little over the $25 (expecting to pay the little bit difference) and paid extra $ for expedited delivery, and gave a 20% tip in advance to the driver. The in-app estimate before I placed the order said it would be 45 min. After waiting an hour and 45 minutes it was intolerable. Plus I realized I was being charged over $50. I went to check status and get help. In frustration I cancelled the order. Big mistake. The food order was cancelled but I still was being charged over $40. I called customer service. Customer service said no problem we'll keep the food order and give a full refund. I got a followup email saying ""Issue Resolved"". I waited another hour for the food that never arrived. I contacted customer service again -- this time through in-app chat -- and was told there was no way to avoid being charged the $40+ cancellation fee. End of story. Customer service rep would not respond to my other questions, or to my request to seek escalation. The charge appeared on my credit card days later. The only saving grace was that I was able to dispute the charge with my credit card so didn't have to pay. I'm still out the original $25 I started with. And hopefully the Uber Eats driver enjoyed the Thai satay I ordered, so maybe someone benefited from the whole horrific affair. Uber Eats is a nasty service and it goes without saying I will never try using the service again and I will passionately attempt to dissuade anyone else from patronizing them.

"I've used Uber Eats for a while now. I put up with the forgotten bags of food and forgotten beverages, the dreadful customer service (the restaurants would make reparations while Uber Eats played their silly dance of first blaming the restaurant, then pretending to misunderstand what the issue is, then finally cheerfully informing you that they're helpless to do anything about it even though it actually really is their fault. But they finally went too far.

I ordered my food, saw and agreed to a $3.49 delivery charge. Saw the tax, saw my total. Everything was exactly as I expected. The food was delivered, they actually had both bags of food and the beverage! I was thinking I hit the Uber Lottery. Until after eating, I checked my email and saw the receipt. Uber Eats had added an additional ""service charge"" of $8.44. Completely unauthorized, never displayed during my order, in my cart, during payment. Just snuck it onto my card without my authorization. First, they tried to tell me it was the restaurant. Then they pretended to think that I was missing something from my order. Finally, they cheerfully informed me that they now charge a percentage of your actual food order ON TOP OF THE DELIVERY FEE THAT YOU AGREE TO. This is ""underway"" and all orders are charged a service fee.

CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS. Had I understood that I was paying almost $12 for delivery of my food, I would've opted for a different delivery service. (As I will in the future, of course.)

And for the record, the service food was NOT included in my cart for me to see. I had one total in my cart that included the food, delivery fee, and tax. I had a completely different amount charged to my card. If this really IS legal, it should not be.

"Firstly I just want to highlight that McDonald's has a policy to not deliver to or near schools and the driver is expected by McDonald's to cancel the delivery by choosing ""other"" followed by leaving a custom note to which the option to leave a custom note doesn't appear for to leave one as it did on the old version of the driver app. For on the older version of the app there was an option to either put in a custom note stating it as a ""failed delivery"" but how is a driver supposed to put in a custom note stating it as a ""school delivery"" when the option to do so isn't available to the driver to put in? On the other hand when a driver is looking after customer satisfaction by cancelling orders on the door steps of any customer of McDonald's over the beverage that comes in a paper cup that spills during transport from an outlet to the customers front door. Partially or at times totally spoiling the entire order that the customer ordered. It's only right that the customer shouldn't have to be paying for it. The driver then gets threatened with dismissal for misuse of the service. This brings in disrepute of the policy McDonald's has in place to expect drivers to not deliver too or near schools by cancelling the order as doing so will also be looked upon by Uber Eats as being in breach of use of service of the Uber driver app and looked upon by Uber Eats as being in breach of the use of service of the Uber driver app which will see the driver unfairly dismissed from carrying on delivering for Uber Eats!

The same applies when accepting a ping, it doesn't state what restaurant the driver is being pinged to go too until it is actually accepted. If it is too far away for the driver to go to depending where any driver is at when receiving a ping to pick up from somewhere that is too far for the driver to go to. Cancelling that and choosing the pre-laid out options as it being too far away to travel too, will also be looked upon by Uber Eats as misuse of the driver app. And again, the threats come rolling out onto the driver of dismissal.

Secondly, I tried to update my uber driver profile by uploading an updated document of my photographic ID The photographic ID I tried to upload twice is that of an electoral ID card but twice they have rejected it. It clearly states on what documents Uber accepts as photographic ID. Being a passport- Driving Licence (from any country)- EU Citizen/Identity Card (OR OTHER PHOTO ID) An electoral ID card falls under that category as (other photo ID) An electoral ID card I can tell you is the next best thing to providing a valid passport. An electoral ID card is an acceptable form of ID when opening a bank account, buying alcohol, proof of identity in claiming unemployment benefit, proof of identity when showing it to a police officer and so on, and most definitely proof of identity in order to vote and that no one is able to vote in the general and local elections without having one. As having an electoral ID card means that anyone who is carrying such a card is in fact registered within the local government database to be eligible to vote in the local and general elections. An electoral ID card is also one of the few identity documents accepted by Deliveroo As with Just Eat and the third party background check Just Eat uses to carry out a background check before taking on delivery drivers which to me I find it really weird as to why Uber Eats as I know of has no problems in rejecting it. I have asked why but all I got was a response of copy and pasted text telling me what I don't already know of what documents are accepted.

I have cameras around the house plus a ring doorbell at my house. I called McDonalds and confirmed that UberEats picked up the food. Tried calling Uber Eats but unable.

"I was robbed by Uber eats. It seems as if they are conniving with their drivers to not deliver food and get money from people fraudulently. I was watching the driver who was supposedly coming to deliver my food but he went to a different location. I contacted the driver to let him know that he was at a wrong location and he dismissed me rudely saying that he had completed the delivery. I called Uber eats who were adamant that the delivery had been completed. They even stole the tip. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told that the supervisor was not available to speak with me. I ended up with no food, money stolen and wasted time talking to Uber eats supposed support team. Avoid Uber!

Well not I got another missing order and that's embarrassing. Then one of the drivers spit in my salsa and now it's missing coleslaw and a drink.

Uber eats is a joke! Never order from them. Every time I order my order take over an hour never sooner even if it says it will only take 20 minutes never under an hour! I ordered tonight and the driver picked up my order and then canceled it so they just have my food. I was refunded but I waited over an hour with no contact from the driver at all!

"I tried this service for the first time and what a joke. They give you an estimated delivery time knowing that the driver is going to do a ton of other stops before he gets to you. SO now it is an hour later and your food has been driving around in the U drivers car getting stone cold. No communication from the driver even thought I expressed my concern to him. Just crickets. My driver Bruce 693EOc was horrible and so is their customer service. I just sat there and watched as he kept extending the time for delivery. It just kept getting worse and worse.

"I placed an order for a Chinese takeaway via Uber eats and expected the food within 20 minutes. We were sat at home waiting for the delivery which never turned up. I was informed via the app that the order was complete, however there had been no sign of anyone.Trying to reach Uber eats is nearly impossible and after multiple attempts, I called the restaurant to be told that the food had been collected some 20/30 minutes prior and their system was marked as delivered. I ended up reordering the food and going to the restaurant to collect it myself, expecting to get a refund for the order and the tip I have given in advance. Finally I've got a response to my multiple emails telling me that they've looked into the complaint and they can see that the delivery partner tried to deliver and waited 7 minutes. I explained that no one attended the property as we have a ring doorbell and no one tried to contact me on my mobile as I have no missed calls and that they must be mistaken, after several emails back and forth with me offering evidence that no one attempted to deliver or call along with proof that I attended and collected the same order, they have now ceased communicating with me with no plans to reimbursement money I spent. This company has no regard for providing a satisfactory service, or fulfilling their orders and should be avoided or better still shut down.

NO SECURITY
I've never had this or ordered from this Uber eats before - I did it once a few months ago since kids and I ordered something.
For 3 months now I've been dealing with a lot of extra charges in my visa I've change the visa but didn't see the charges until the bill came and I called. Thousands of dollars!
The same thing happened to my daughter also through Pay Pal

"I placed an order through the website. My food was picked up by the Uber driver and was later reported as unable to be delivered. My home is a residential address, my front door was open, and my dog was standing guard. If anyone had so much is come into the driveway I would have known it. The notice from the driver indicated that it was unable to be delivered and the food was returned to the restaurant. When I called the restaurant, they said that they had not received the food back. Our only options at this point was for the restaurant to make me more food, which they offered to do it no charge, but they weren't even being paid for the first round because the order was canceled after the Uber driver listed it as unable to be delivered! How dare Uber put somebody in a position to have to pay for their services and supplies twice!?

I proceeded to call Uber Eats to try to see if we could get a hold of the driver and get them back to my house for going any thoughts of them stealing the food, or not doing their job. Just trying to make it right. Uber shared, and no uncertain terms, that they cannot help anyone who did not place the order on the app. If you don't order from the app, you cannot get help from them.

I cannot believe that they are so unwilling to help, but the restaurant who is losing money by using Uber Eats in the first place is being backed into a corner and that the only way that can this can be resolved is for them to lose even more money.

Screw you Uber Eats.

Call chick fil a manager says yes man your fruit is sitting here driver didn't pick it up. Manager proceeds to say we don't pack cold food with hot food. So Uber blocked me from a refund but I didn't get my food. Chick fil a manager says they have a notebook filled with food left by Uber. That's disturbing.

I waited, and 1:05 PM came and went, I checked the tracking app, and it said they were on the way but did not display their location, which has happened before. I figured it was just taking more time, which has also happened before, as the delivery is an estimation. When I checked the tracking app again at 1:20 PM, it said the order had been cancelled at 1:19 PM, with no explanation given. I received no phone call, no text letting me know. Nor did I have in my order any items with instructions to cancel the order if they weren't available. I can't access the receipt (yet), but if I'm charged, I'll definitely be fighting it. This is definitely poor business practice to simply cancel an order yet not contact the customer to let them know. Can't say I'll be ordering them from again..

They say because I had ""significant"" refunds. Those ""significant"" refunds were for my previous TWO orders which had to be refunded because of their or the restaurant's mess up, in all my history between Uber and Postmates. Those orders deserved a refund, and this one most certainly does since I never received my food that I ordered and have UNDENIABLE proof I received the wrong order. It isn't even a refund to my bank account I'm asking for. I'm asking for the credit I had on my account back that I used since the last time they messed up. I will be reviewing this (under Postmates and Uber Eats) on every site, contacting their legal team, and my own lawyer, since as I told them - I don't care if it was a small amount - I believe in consumer protections and they are committing fraud by using some hack refund/community policy and not rightfully refunding customers who show proof they are owed a refund.

"An hour after my order was delivered, Uber charged an addition $9 to my total! They wrote that it was for driver tip but the driver tip was already included in my original total. What I noticed is that they subsequently changed the delivery fee on the invoice from $. 99 to $7.99. I am absolutely positive that they pulled a fast one here. I've tried for 1 1/2 hours to contact Uber but I've had major trouble getting anyone in customer service (whether by phone or online... by they way, they don't accept phone calls... you have to send messages through their app/website) but I'm having no luck. After this, I will never order from Uber eats ever again.
Tip for consumers:
Be careful because if something goes wrong with your order, customer service is impossible to get through to. They added an additional charge, that I did not approve, an hour after delivery and I can't get anyone's attention at Uber. I just submitted a claim to paypal.

"On April 24 I ordered like a bunch of taco bell, and I noticed my Fiesta potatoes weren't there. So I requested a refund and got like a $2 credit. But THEN, I looked through the rest and other items were missing or completely different things from what I asked for. Wrong meats, drink was 2 sizes too small, etc. So I went back in to request another refund, but because I had done that they wouldn't let me do another. So I called, got the money refunded, all is well. Then a week later I go to order lunch or something and my account is frozen? It says I owe 30 something dollars, which happened to be the amount they refunded me. I called and they said a team would be investigating the issue. Fast forward to tonight and no one has contacted me, so I messaged them. They are now telling me that the extra charge is LEGITIMATE and they're asking me to pay it or I can't use my account.
I am absolutely livid, and will be using Door Dash from here on out. I didn't get the food I paid for and now they are asking me to fork over the money AGAIN.
Absolutely outrageous business practices, support is completely unhelpful, seriously just DON'T waste your time

"I received an email from Uber giving me 50% off an order of $50 or more for groceries. Great! I placed an order at Safeway to be delivered the following day. Little did I know that I could not edit the order or chat with the person doing my shopping. Nor was I notified of any changes or substitutions. The order was scheduled for 5-6 pm. It got here almost an hour early, and I was not notified of that either. I ordered 2 of the 2 liter bottles of soda. They were out so I had put down to get a six pack of 16.9 oz bottles as a sub. Well, the shopper got me 2 of those, instead of the 1 I ordered. That cost an extra $6.58. I ordered 7 bananas. I received 7 pounds of HUGE bananas! Do you know how many bananas are in 7 pounds? 16! Look at the picture. I am so unhappy. I will never order groceries on Uber again. I can't even complain about this to them. There is no where to do that, so I am screwed!

"I am appalled that this miserable service is still in business! I have spent thousands of dollars on them since covid which makes no difference to them. 9 times out of 10, something is wrong with my order from a food delivery service, so I complain and expect to get reimbursed for what was wrong or left out. I ordered from Dominics yesterday, spent $53.00 and an item for $3.75 was left out. After arguing with the imbeciles at costumer service for over an hour, they finally told me my account is restricted because of the refunds they had to give in the past. Even though they left food that I paid for out of this order-tough! My account was obviously not too restricted since they accepted the order and took my money. DoorDash is wonderful and I highly recommend them. They actually have common sense as one of their basics and don't penalize the customer for restaurant mistakes. I will never use Uber Eats again as long as I live. If I could give them a minus 0 rating, I would.

I had to wait 10-15 minutes for chipotle to make the first two orders and after finally receiving the orders I proceeded next door to the chiles to pick up the last order. I then delivered said orders on time and as directed by the customers. After completion my tip was removed and my $20 order became $9. I screenshot this to have proof. A couple hours later it had been changed on the app that I received the full tip when I never received $11 of it. I also took a screenshot of this. This was not warranted. I am a diamond status driver with 100% satisfaction rate. I contacted support through live chat in regards to this and was continuously transferred to a ""more capable agent."" I then attempted to call and speak to someone over the phone but was placed on hold for over 20 minutes before the agent hung up on me without saying a word. Uber treats their drivers like complete trash and are not afraid to cover up stuff they should be correcting.

I could see on the map they were parked a block away so after I few minutes I tried to call the driver a couple times to see if they were lost but it was a non-working number. Then I got a notification that the driver was trying to reach me but I has no missed calls, texts or messages in the app. A little while later an old black sedan pulled up and a man (that I doubt was named Veronica) started walking up to my door. It turned out to be my order but it was more than a little concerning that the driver, car and contact information were incorrect. I sent a chat to Uber, the rep, Vinit, said he understood my concern that I received the wrong order which I didn't. Even though I had typed a detailed explanation at the beginning of the chat he was clueless. When I asked if he saw my original message he immediately end the chat (see screen shot). To top it off I received an email from Uber a couple of days later saying that they weren't going to give me a refund. I never asked for one! Inexcusable ""customer service"".

I called the restaurant first to see if they were unable or if it was UberEATS. She told me the driver picked up my food already. So I called UberEATS who informed me that the driver was confused by the address so he cancelled the order. Interesting... it was being delivered to a well-known business in a single building (no suite number). UberEATS generously offered to refund my money (duh), but said they couldn't refund the tip! Seriously? So you want me to tip your driver for stealing my food? She says, ""you don't have to worry, we will refund your money for your food"". Oh what a relief! I thought I might have to worry about my husband not having lunch and the thief driver getting tipped. Wait, that's PRECISELY what happened! I will NEVER order through UberEATS again. Side note...

We're currently unable to adjust tips if you have chosen to tip after the order is completed. This is because 100% of the amount you tip goes to the delivery person, and they receive your selected tip directly after you choose the tip amount.

Reaching out to share my one and only experience with Uber Eats. Simple story really. Ordered some ice cream, and had it delivered. Simple right... when the couple arrived at my home to drop off the order. The female literally started begging for a large tip. I mean I understand they don't get paid much, but this was to the point that we had to hide in our homes as this woman yelled ""Please, give us a better tip, over and over again.

I have promptly removed my credit information and deleted the app. Ive been using Skip the dishes for years and have never experienced this. Sorry, Uber eats, hire sane and professional ppl andyou'll keep new customers. Wow that was just terrible and disgusting service.

"Uber Rats is good until something is moot good. Received bloody, foul smelling food delivered to me by Uber Eats.
Turns out Uber Eats is responsible for the full refund but they don't tell you that. I contacted them n restaurant right away. Uber refunded me $13 out of $44.22.
Restaurant said they'd contact me re: a refund fior the remainder $31.23, didn't hear anything for 48 hrs. I was then told Uber Eats was responsible for full refund.
Contacted Uber Eats again and was told I'm too late now cause it's been 48hrs., even though I had contacted them immediately initially.
Sounds like a scam- lead ppl to believe that they did their part ( partial refund), you go after restaurant for the remainder only to find out Uber Eats was to provide the full refund initially. So by the time you get back to them, it's too late for your refund.

"I inadvertently placed a order today as I had items in my cart at one restaurant and decided to order from another. I hit backspace and it placed order to first restaurant i was considering. I noticed it immediately and in less than 1 minute contacted uber, as there was no option for me to cancel it thru app.
Now i have 2 order from 2 different restaurants arriving at same house at same time. Seems like there should be something in app that verifies that this is desired because obviously this was a mistake. I immediately contacted uber and they wouldn't cancel my order. They said i had to cancel it w restaurant but i made my order thru them. They have horrible customer service. I tried to contact the merchant but of course there was no phone number listed only a chat with and they never responded. After going back and forth with uber eats they finally gave me the merchants telephone number and by this time the order had already been filled and driver picked up order. The restaurant didnt actual answer the text only number until 2 hours after the food had already been delivered. Now any other time my uber order is always at least 30 plus minutes delayed from expected arrival but today of course not.
I won't be using uber eats again. They up price more than other apps, don't have accurate delivery times and if you are paying for service and something happens they should be helpful in resolving the issue especially when contacting them promptly regarding.

The only thing that was fresh/good was the side salad. I called the restaurant but they had already closed. I then decided to reach out to Uber Eats for a refund of everything minus the fresh salad. I wasn't thinking about pics at the time but I should've taken some of that dry meat and old Mac and Cheese before serving the dogs. Uber Eats decided not to reimburse me. If I would have realized it so.close to closing time I would have NEVER chose to order from that particular restaurant and chose another. I will NEVER order from this service ever again!

"I was ordering ubereats nearly everyday throughout the pandemic. There were so many times my food was late, cold, missing items or didn't show up at all. I sent many complaints which is acceptable due to how much I'm paying for a service plus tipping. I pretty much stopped ordering as much the past year. I was frustrated with the service. I received a gift card for Uber eats so I used it tonight. I ordered from Outback steakhouse. I ordered a pasta/steak meal, 2 apps, and 2 desserts. Well they never sent the pasta/steak, were late and the apps were cold. I couldn't believe I was missing items again. WTF. I called Uber and they said they couldn't issue me a refund because my account if flagged. It was flagged due to too many complaints from the past. I can't get a refund. My order was $78 plus tip. I'm just completely done with Uber. Yes I had a lot of complaints but I also ordered 5 to 7 days a week so yes I would have more complaints/missing food than the average person.
So since they don't understand that and there's no way to get refunds for missing food and crap service, I'm never ordering again.

"Got a gift card for Uber Eats. Tried to order something from a restaurant in the town where I live, I estimate it to be 10-12 minutes from my home. I put the order in and went to pay. I had to supplement the gift card with a credit card, which I did. The site refused to take the card. I tried 2 more cards and spent a half hour trying to figure out why the site wouldn't take them. I reviewed my info several times and it was all correct. The site didn't specify what the problem was. I scrapped the order and tried another restaurant that was also in town and in the same vicinity as the first one. This order was less and was covered by the gift card and it went through. The order took way too long to get here and the burgers and fries were cold and the fries were soggy. The restaurant failed to include the requested condiments and the plastic utensils. They didn't even include napkins. That was the first and last time I will use Uber Eats.
Tip for consumers:
If you are willing to pay the high cost of restaurant food today and willing to accept cold, soggy food, then Uber Eats is for you. It's not for me. I'll order over the phone, pick up my order and make sure everything is in the bag, and get it home before it gets cold and soggy. It's worth the little bit of extra effort. It's just not worth eating cold and soggy food and grousing about it the whole time you're eating it. Uber Eats is only for people who have no standards with what they eat.

"Uber eats takes your ratings down IMMEDIATELY if you get a thumbs down but refuses to take your ratings up after receiving many thumbs ups. They then allow people to falsely rate without you ever knowing why you receIved a thumbs down. They allow people to make false reports and then tell you that you you need to keep a certain rating in which different areas have different requirements which makes no sense/ it's discriminatory. Why would you even have a rating system that is strictly based off non investigation, their should be a system where people can make reports that way Uber can determine if it is false or not. The system is based on racism and Uber will lie about emails they have sent. Uber eats will tell you if you fall below a certain percentage they are going to deactivate you, then deactivate before you even drop below, I've witnessed it on a friends account and then they'll lie, OHHH AND THE CUSTOMERS: these people are the reason businesses don't stay long because of their weak a$$ complaints, if a bag tears slightly, they make reports of it being tampered and a thumbs down, if the restaurant is not done preparing the food and you notify them of it, you get a thumbs down, and Uber eats which another reason the rating system is dumb. These people will say they'll meet you at the door and take FOREVER To meet you even if it is late at night which is NOT SAFE AT ALL. Then they expect you wait past Ubers dumb 8 min timer. Oh and don't let someone look slightly different from their profile, thumbs down, like even if it's the same person. These people will live in apartments and ask to leave at door when they live on a narrow street with no parking, or they'll tell you leave it their door and sometimes the doorman won't be at the front desk and they'll want you to wait ten min when Uber wants you to wait 8 minutes before you leave when they could simply walk their lazy a$$es to get the food or they'll say leave at the door, but then the door man won't even let you up and will make you leave it in the lobby. Then you'll get. Thumbs down for that. Also there should be questions that Uber eats asked before eating because if a restaurant messes up an order, why would you allow them to give the driver a thumbs down? Make it make sense Then you have the bums that lie just to get their money back. Lame complaints from customers, Real complaints from drivers, discriminatory practices with drivers and restaurants. Uber eats is bound to be corrupt soon. Allow PROOF or actual reasons to give a thumbs down. I see why Uber has many lawsuits

Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I got this ""Your FREE meal up to $25 is waiting. Enjoy!"" email. Everything was fine, then suddenly Uber eats told me that my address seemed far away and I needed to try another promo. I've ordered from them before and other delivery services. I've ordered from that restaurant before without a problem. Now I'm far away, then they tried to steer me to a ""deal"" that was more expensive. I tried to use their chat and it didn't help. I found their customer service number, waited on hold, someone finally picked up and all I heard was laughing and joking. Uber Eats is the worst of the worst. They didn't want to honor the $25 promo is what this was all about. A bait and switch. I won't be ordering any delivery through them again.

"My husband thought it may be a good idea to order some food from Uber eats, McDonald's to be specific,to save me some time after work to not have to cook dinner. So he proceeded to order two quarter pounders with cheese and two large fries from McDonald's. Got the bill, the lady came and just handed him the order after trying to find where we were at, and handed him two bags of food. He asked her, ""why you handing me two bags"" because well this is your order she said. This is not our order she said yes it is and left. My husband decided that he was going to go in the house and try and call the number that was on the receipt on the package. Nobody would answer the phone. After several attempts, nobody would answer this phone. I got home and he told me what had happened and we're like what are we going to do with all this food? We don't eat hamburgers on a regular basis like this. So we decided that maybe they would come back for it once they realized what had happened. So we're sitting here waiting for the people to maybe call us back. Haven't heard anything from anyone yet and this is Wednesday this started Tuesday night. So I wake up Wednesday morning and I check my balance for my card and stuff and I have a charge of $88.95 on my card from Uber eats! Now how in the hell are you going to charge me for a mistake that you did, you would not rectify? You wouldn't even call back! You had our number! This is the first and THE VERY LAST TIME that we will EVEN EVER CONSIDER using Uber eats again! This was so wrong it was stupid! They should really get rid of Uber eats! It is worthless!
Tip for consumers:
Do not ever use Uber eats unless you want to lose your money!!

"I placed an order through the app and the delivery driver took my food to someone else's home and thought that I would want it after she went to go retrieve it back. I called customer service to explain the situation and made the rep aware that due to Covid and I work in a medical facility, that we would not accept it and wanted a full refund. The rep then goes to say I couldn't get a refund until the driver canceled the order…. Ok bet. Driver standing in front of me and she cancels. Rep. Oh you have to call back in 45 minutes to see if a refund can be issued! Oh hell no! I get off the phone with the unprofessional rep and call again. The new rep issued my refund with no hesitation and understood my reasoning for the refund. Uber eats will never get my business again EVER!

"They sent me promo coupon due to recent uber driver services a few times, which I ignored. Today they sent me again saying it's the last chance. So I tried and ordered with the promo coupon provided. It seemed applied successfully, however, when they send me the receipt, the promo coupon actually did not applied to the balance. Besides the extra services fees, delivery fees, the cost is almost 50% higher than I just order and pick up from the restaurant nearby. I was able to use chat function to ask help from a customer service, he claimed that he adjusted and refund the portion related to the promo code, and would send me an email. But I never received the email. While chatting with him, he abrupted ended the chat. When I try to chat again, found the chat function on my account was disabled. It's a very disappointing experience. Hope just never tried and may never try again.

"I live in Manhattan NY. I ordered from a local restaurant. The driver brought the dinner in a timely manner and it was good. The second time I tried to order a similar dinner from the same restaurant. I was using a computer and could not register the site on my phone. The site wiped the information page and I lost contact with the driver. There is no phone or connection help from Uber that I could find. The driver lett the meal on the street in from of my house. It was found by a neighbor and brought in. I cannot blame the driver for this debacle. I blame Uber. I will not use their services again. I never had this problem with Gubhub or other services I used. The lack of a way to retrieve information is essential for this kind of service. My experience was bad and will not use them again for anything.

"Ordered from UberEats during our snowstorm (wasn't snowing at that moment) and after about 5 minutes I realized nothing was happening on their tracker, so I called the restaurant and found out it was closed due to the weather. In the meantime whoever was there or maybe the restaurant's system automatically accepted the order (even tho store was closed). Went to UberEats to cancel the order, really as a courtesy, and they said because the order was accepted (at a restaurant that was closed so also I blame the restaurant) they were going to charge me 13.27 to compensate the driver (who didn't exist) and themselves of course. That is actually more than the cost of the meal I ordered. I threatened a lawsuit and they gave me a $5.00 credit (big whoop). I'll use that credit once and then cancelling my subscription.

"I was gifted Uber Eats gift two cards totaling $50. I decided to use them for two Pizza Hut carry-out pizzas. I was stunned to find that one pizza through Uber Eats was $46.48. I ordered a second identical pizza directly from Pizza Hut and the cost was $17.35. I use this Pizza Hut regularly and that is the ""normal"" price for the pizza I ordered. When I picked up the two pizzas, I asked the manager why there would be such a huge difference in the cost of two identical pizzas. He just laughed and said I'd have to ask Uber Eats. All the customers in the store heard the story and got a good laugh. Of course there is no way to talk to Uber Eats but no explanation could possibly justify a $30 up charge on a $18 pizza. Done with Uber Eats, never again.

"Worst company I have ever company across! I can confidently say I will never use any of Uber services again and I will sell all of my shares! I ordered £20 worth of food, my food never arrived and uber refused to give me a refund! The customer ""support"" said I should write a negative review about the merchant but they cant provide a refund. So I paid £20 for food I never ate and they did absolutely nothing about it at all but say ""we understand your disappointment"". This wasn't the merchant fault, I used uber services to receive a delivery and it never arrived! I can't believe that my money was literally just stolen from Uber. Honestly the worst company I have ever company across and I will never be a customer again. I highly recommend not using uber eats because if anything happens to your order order they will do nothing about it and just ""apologise for the inconvenience'. You are the worst company on the planet, I am disgusted! This review will go wherever I am able to write a review. I hope Uber goes bust for stealing my money!

"After initially emailing and explaining that the app had suggested the food would not arrive for 3 minutes (it kept saying that it would be another 3 minutes for nearly 20 minutes), and that they should look into their app they suggested I rate the driver and call the restaurant.

First of all, I've told them that the concern is the application itself (that they should look into) which after emailing them again, they explained that I should rate the driver and call the restaurant. What? Either they don't read their emails properly or their Customer Department is just told to throw out canned responses regardless of what the issue is.

If in fact, somehow this issue was the result of the driver or the restaurant, Uber Eats doesn't seem to take any responsibility for the third parties that they are affiliated with. I've used Skip the Dishes and have only occasionally used Uber Eats. I will no longer being using Uber Eats. Skip the Dishes when faced with issues, take accountability for the product, not directing the customer to follow up.

I also was delivered that food from this place. I find out that I'm going to be charged for the first cancel delivery when I ask why they tell me the merchant started making my food. Well that can't be because within one second all I did was change the address, not cancel the order a the order is placed on the app one minute apart so even if they had started making my food, they didn't lose anything because I re-ordered it right away But I know they didn't start making it in one minute but regardless I got that food. All I did was change the address and they are trying to charge me the additional $35 so it would be $70 for a pizza what they're saying makes no sense and it is a total lie. They are just trying to rob me so I canceled my premium account I'm going to dispute. The charges with my credit card is fraud and I'm never going to use Uber again when I use literally almost use them daily and they let a premium member go also they could keep this $35 they seem pretty desperate and after that I would never trust them again there total liars and the customer service is terrible.

"The only positive review I can give is to the customer service rep who was able to cancel my order that was 2 hours late and couldn't get a driver for. While Uber Eats loves to spam my email with rewards and deals, none of them are applicable to any of the restaurants within a 40 mile radius of my home. So I'm really not getting a good deal. Also, there are barely any uber eats drivers which is why my order was 2+ hours late. No one was accepting the pick up. I ordered with Doordash five minutes after my Uber Eats order was cancelled and a driver immediately accepted it. I got it in under 30 minutes, no complaints. And it was even cheaper than UberEats. Same restaurant, same order. Switch to Doordash.

The time before this they had taped up the plastic bag in a perfect manner. This time it was like they were being too cheap and careless. Right after I wrote the review on them, they wrote back saying that they ALWAYS tape it up secure for UBER EATS etc. and how whatever happens when the driver picks up the food is NOT their responsibility!

"1. Drivers get to restaurant, but then cancel the order forcing Uber Eats to find another driver only for them to do the same. Dudes, just go to the place and pick up the order and bring it here!
2. Drivers take the longest routes possible when the shorter routes would guarantee food safety is being met! Where are you guys going, going in the OPPOSITE direction of my house!?
3. Good luck getting straight answers, cause they have an automated bot replying and not fully grasping what you're telling them.
4. I pay for priority service, in the hopes that they aren't taking alt routes to get to my place. That they take the order straight here. In the hopes that the food will be edible. It is an absolute joke.
5. Uber Eats is a business designed to pick up orders and bring them to the customers. But they are no longer efficient.
6. Oh and good luck getting EVERYTHING in your order. They will not double check the order to make sure everything is there. I've been shorted menu items because the stores went ""Here you go"" to uber eats and NEITHER ONE checked to make sure everything was THERE.
Tip for consumers:
Make sure you put in instructions, to tell both uber eats and restaurant to double check the order is complete. Make sure you give adequate instructions about where your driveway is located. Make double certain that you check the order as well when it arrives. Do not become complacent sheep about this. Speak up, use your voice and don't let people walk all over you.

They refunded me for the food, but they did not refund me the $10 tip. They gave it as a credit but since I will never order from them again, it doesn't do me any good. I even asked that this be escalated and go to a supervisor and they said that they don't have any way to give me the tip back to my credit card and that it has to be a credit.

I reached out to Uber that half my coffee was missing and just like the first time they refused me a refund and it was pretty much a ""not our problem"" kind of thing. They told me to reach out for further assistance to which no one ever got back to me. I never have this problem with DoorDash and Grubhub.

"After my first mishap with them of no one delivering my food after 2 hours I thought to stupidly give them another chance…well I was wrong to. I ordered Starbucks when I received my coffees and sandwiches my ice coffee was melted and there was no ice left, my sandwiches were cold and my grande hot coffee was cold and only half the cup was full. I reached out to Uber that half my coffee was missing and just like the first time they refused me a refund and it was pretty much a ""not our problem"" kind of thing. They told me to reach out for further assistance to which no one ever got back to me. I never have this problem with DoorDash and Grubhub. If there's an issue they refund you no problems but Uber eats ask for proof you show them proof and then it's like oh well. They are literally the worst I would of been fine with credits but they don't even bother.

"I placed an order and canceled it immediately when I discovered it was going to the wrong location. They continue to process my order even though it was confirmed that it was canceled and they took my money. When I called Uber Eats I spoke with a man named Joseph who also confirmed that it was canceled and still claims that I would not get a refund called the entire cost of the order a cancellation fee which by the was is over $50 and refused to call the place to change the location to send it too! When I asked to speak to a supervisor he said one would call back but didn't give a timeframe in fact he said there wasn't a timeframe, and that his supervisor name is Kevin. He was very unprofessional and I now am out of money and I never got the order that again should have never been processed since I canceled the order.

"If you could get an award for the worst service in the entire universe UberEats Sa would win and take 2nd and 3rd place.

It is the company with the worst customer service I have ever encountered and giving one star rating is actually very generous.

Placing an order at 19:00 from BurgerKing after almost two hours (20:42) no delivery was made. Three drivers was assigned and multiple complaints were logged and phone calls were made.

"I am appalled by the response from the customer service. Here's the situation: I placed an order with UberOne (the ""premium"" service) which was delivered late. They promised me a €5 compensation, but I never received it. I contacted customer service for information, and they assured me I would be fully refunded. However, after placing another order a few days later, I discovered that a product was missing from my order. I couldn't report it because I already had a refund in progress. In the end, I received neither compensation nor refund. I am very disappointed with how the customer service handled this situation.

I quote:
""We have reviewed your account and found that you have submitted multiple refund and adjustment requests for your orders.

For this reason, we are unable to adjust the price of this order.

Thank you for chatting with us today. Have a good day. Goodbye!""

"June 17,2023: My wife just ordered from Uber Eats for Father's Day. $75 order from Taka Japanese restaurant in Wayne, NJ. The Uber driver sent a picture of the door where the food was left through the Uber App which was not our door. When we contacted them to complain that we never received the food and that the house shown on the pic provided by the driver was not our house, several chat people (I chatted with 2 different agents) stated that the order address was correct (which it was) and that the food was delivered to that address, which of course was not true. I told them that their driver did not deliver to the address they confirmed and asked to speak to a manager. Uber Eats would not provide a manager on the chat nor a phone number we could call to speak to someone in person in order to file a complaint. They refused to refund the order, holding to the lie that the food was actually delivered to the address on record. I told them I could send them a picture of our home to prove that their driver was lying, but they simply repeated the lie and stopped the chat 2 times. I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. I had used them many times before, but will NEVER USE THEM AGAIN after this despicable incident. Uber Customer service is an absolute scam. They will take your money, drop off the food anywhere and then refuse to deal with the customer when confronted. The app provided NO SALES RECEIPT.

"Terrible customer service and terrible ownership But I expect that from those people that work up there. I ordered on Uber eats and I got the 10 piece with extra crispy and all drum. Extra crispy and all drum cost about 75 cent each so I paid for it. When it came I didn't have the all drums or the extra crispy but of course you know they charged me. They obviously don't pay attention to what people order or they don't care. I think it's because they just don't care. And if you go up there and look at those type of people they actually look like the type of people they don't care about anything or anyone unless they look and talk like them. Uber eats didn't give me my money back because they said the store doesn't do refunds. So I would advise people to not order from Uber eats at the store and honestly I won't be going back at all.

"So for months leading up to about two months ago, Uber eats was sending me come back please come back. I had so many issues in the past with deliveries and people not checking the orders. So going to have hip and knee replacement surgery and I started Uber eats again. I have placed three orders. All three orders were wrong not only wrong, but everyone was late by 15 to 30 minutes from its original time. I had people deceive me the drivers deceive me three orders in a row were wrong today I ordered from Karaba's. I didn't get bread which I requested to chop double check the order to make sure I got two loaves of bread and all the salad dressings and everything that go along with it not only was I missing, the bread, but my salad dressing why would you give me a salad to salad with no dressing no house dressing. I was also missing the ricotta in my meatballs and ricotta side item. So when I asked the young lady and she was very nice if she had saw my message to check the over order over double and triple to make sure I had everything. She said no they told me it was all there, and then she told me that she's not allowed to open the bag which is not correct. So I subsequent her tip based on that theory and lie. This was a big mistake to come back to you. I know nobody cares. I know nobody is going to read this and contact me. And that's fine.

"I mainly do Uber eats for extra money on the side, I like DoorDash better due to Uber eats sending you to restaurants that are closed or permanently closed and only giving you $3 for a $21+ order. They take forever when it comes to customer service/getting help. Recently I did delivers all night and when I went to cash out, it wouldn't let me. They told me I have a hold on my account bc of not delivering my deliveries when I know that I delivered every single one.
I'm wondering if a customer lied or what but they should be able to see my driving/me msging my customers telling them that I delivered their food. It's annoying because I can't get all my hard work/earned money and have to wait for this process for them to go everything which will take forever.

I got the order delivered and the next morning I noticed that the promo was later removed and I was charged 40 dollars more than the invoice. What was even more surprising is that the bill has also changed! There was no trace of the expired promo on the app either. When I contacted support, they said they couldn't help without a screenshot of the promo I used! I showed them my credit card transactions that I was initially charged 60 dollars and later they charged me 100 by crediting 60 but they wouldn't help. It felt so like a genuine scam to me.

They request new driver time frame i wont be around the time it arrive. There so much problem uber eat cause that if this doesnt stop going they show no respect toward customers or how you feel pretty soon no one will order from you. Cause that true treat people how you want to be treated show respect to customor customers is alway right. But never take advance of customers never use customers money has greed. Most importantly show honor for people who has memebership. If order keep coming in wrong or incorrect. Or Driver cancel and request new one if customor is busy cant be around yall not gonna refund when it wasnt customers fault for time frame it suppose to be and stop? If it cancel person need to be going out yall dont listen that customor wont be around that time. Ur gonna still charge them that is call poor customor service.

"I made the MISTAKE of leaving GrubHub after the site reported suspicious activity on my account and logged me out. However, now that I think about it, no additional fees were missing from my bank account & I believe it was simply a technical error. Long story short, I rejoined GrubHub recently(I will NEVER leave again as it's been THE BEST food experience for me ever) and will not be using Uber Eats again in the future. Uber Eats reminds me too much of my HORRIBLE experience with Door Dash and the shady, sketchy, dishonest people they tend to hire.

A restaurant cancelled my order and Uber Eats DID NOT refund the money to my account AT ALL although they were supposed to. It showed as a PENDING refund transaction(for 24 dollars) in my bank account but NEVER went through. Reason being, Uber Eats KEPT my money and DID NOT even CREDIT it to my Uber Eats account. I have NEVER had that issue with GrubHub! GRUBHUB ALWAYS refunds my money AUTOMATICALLY rather I cancel the order or the restaurant cancels it. It may take a few minutes to show up in my account but it always DOES.

However, the final straw for me with Uber Eats was not only the young lady who bothered showing up to work on a 100 degree day, but refused to get out of her car and walk two feet to come inside my AIR CONDITIONED apartment building to deliver my food as instructed, but instead, insisted she was not coming in because it was too hot and I needed to come out to her(pajamas and all), but also the rude young man who showed up a day later acting as if common sense were a foreign language basically claiming he did not know how to turn a corner in my super small complex to find my building address. He also threw my straw on the ground because I told him he needed to turn the corner to find my building(bear in mind there are only three buildings on each side. Not exactly a maze). He was being facetious and I have no time for that. GOODBYE Uber Eats! Kick rocks! HELLO AGAIN GrubHub! Please forgive me for forsaking your AWESOME service!

So happy I know that Uber Eats is not all it's cracked up to be! NEVER EVER again! Uber Eats is simply a more upscale version of Door Dash(sic). If you've ever used Door Dash, you know that's not saying very much!
Tip for consumers:
If you're considering leaving GrubHub to use Uber Eats, DON'T do it for ANY reason. It's not worth it in my honest opinion.

"I deleted this app and will never use this service again. I recently needed to cancel an order and went through the process. The app and Uber never disclosed that at the point in my order I would not receive any sort of refund. If I had known this or was informed in the order cancellation process I would have never canceled the order. I've now paid for food that is no longer getting delivered to me. Who would want that out of a food delivery service? That's not ethical. I would understand if I had been warned beforehand about this charge during to cancellation order process but instead found this out after the fact. The customer service team gave me some awesome cookie cutter responses about reaching out to support when cancelling an order in the future. Why have the option to do it yourself in the app if best practice is to reach out to their team? I'd be careful with this one. Use DoorDash or Favor, I've never had this issue with them. Zero stars

"On 5/30/23 we order a bill amount of $120+ through Uber Eats from a local restaurant.
Per usual, it was assigned to a driver who sat outside the restaurant for 10-15 minutes ""picking up our order"" before cancelling.
We were then assigned a new driver.
That new driver came and he delivered ONLY lemonade.
When we asked him what happened, he said the restaurant told him, ""a different Uber driver picked up the food.""
Called the restaurant, they confirmed his story. Nobody could or wanted to help refund or remedy the situation.
So I paid for the dinner AGAIN & we called Uber Eats customer service.
They took a WHOLE $#*! REPORT, told me I'd be contact directly by a representative in 24/48 hours and a refund would occur to the original payment method on file.
I've watched every day since then and have yet to 1) get a call back or 2) see a refund.
6/12/23: I called Uber customer service to f/u. They want to tell me that they see I spoke to someone but that someone only mentioned giving us a call back, NOT issuing a refund. So because this is over 8 hours old, THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE MONEY.
I asked to speak or be transferred to a supervisor - but told there were none and I'd have to be called back.
I asked to speak to the supervisor - told that I'd get the exact same answer about not refunding my money.
I asked to speak to the supervisor - and was told that ""I can file a complaint against the driver through a different department"".
I told her the issue isn't with the driver, it's with Uber. It's their employee that stole my food, it's their customer service team who incorrectly told me one think while documentating something entirely different. It's their department who is JUSTIFYING a driver STEALING $120+ of food from a customer and NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM.
They claim they'll call me today. They claim I'll speak to someone who has their head pulled from their $#*!. And they claim I will NOT receive a refund.

"I saw I had a promo code for 90% off if I spend at least R150, so I decided to use it. I decided to use the code and after saying that my order would only be R40 it took the full amount of R170 off my card. I immediately tried to cancel the order and then it got canceled but charged R150 as a cancelation fee off my R170 order, leaving me poor and with no food. The app is poorly designed and confusing and the fee of cancelation after a just minute off placing the order when the restaurant could not have possibly started making my food is ridiculous. After numerous phone calls I was then told to use the help feature on the app which was of no assistance whatsoever!

"I had the worst experience ever with Uber Eats! They kept my money and refused to let me speak to a Supervisor and two agents hung up on me and were terribly rude. It takes 2-5 days to get your money back IF they decide to give it to you. My order was cx becuz the app wasn't working and the food was going to go to the wrong address, so I called support immediately after. When I called customer service, not only did they refuse to refund my money, but they lied and told me that the order had already been processed, which was impossible. There is no one to file a complaint or grievance with. They won't let you speak to anyone and they NEVER solved my problem and I didn't get my food either. I canceled my subscription and will never use their services again!

"The company is total disrespect for the customer! Every time I have to use their services I am greatly disappointed. A glitchy app and website, useless customer support, nonsensical policies, scam. Complete trash.
Here's a couple of examples. I get two $25 vouchers. Uber Eats does not let me apply them both to one order (!). OK, I am placing one order for $24, and then another one for $24. Those crooks apply one $25 voucher to my first order, and then the remaining $1 - to the second order and charge my credit card for $23! The customer has no control over it when placing orders. What's even worse, when placing the second order, the website shows me that it would apply my voucher and my total would be $0... but then I eventually get charged for $23. Scam! I submit a ticket with their customer service demanding explanation and refund. After a long back-and-forth over email I am left with nothing. ""It is how it works. No refund will be issued."" Basically: suck it up.
Here's another one. I am trying to place a pickup order. It only shows me a delivery option (for $5) for that restaurant location. I don't want to pay for the delivery. The restaurant is on my way. I'd rather pick up my order. It is my choice. Out of curiosity, I go to the restaurant and talk to them. They are saying: ""Of course, we do accept pickups. It is Uber Eats that does something so the option is not available. We don't know why."" Scam #2!
The only reason I am still a customer is that my employer sends me free vouchers every now and then. A necessary evil. Shame!

"Awful service, the first night i signed up to there Uber One service and received the worst service I've ever experienced from a food delivery company.
My first order was on it's way, the driver was 7min away then it went to 11min, then 12min then the driver cancelled it.
I called the restaurant who confirmed the driver had left ages ago with my order. I went through every help section sending messages, nowhere there to contact direct. Even tried googling, no number that would go through unless i wanted to pay £3.60 a minute. After half an hour looking, reordered and waited ages again. 2 or 3 drivers arrived at the restaurant and then cancelled. By the time the final driver arrived and delivered my food was 9.40pm and originally started my order at 6.25pm!
Never again, why can i contact DELIVEROO CUSTOMER SERVICES AND NOT YOURS?

"I've had numerous complaints from local individuals about their food being delivered to wrong address, arriving late, never announcing delivered, not being delivered within the time frame for food safety standards... A prior home owner from 3 owners ago (my house) failed to update their address in their uber eats and I started getting their orders all of a sudden. I've tried it a few times and often felt uncomfortable eating the food for fear of sanitation concerns.

The job it self isn't all that great. I had a friend do it and you're pretty much a delivery driver. Good lord it's not that difficult to read an address fellow uber eats coworkers. Pay isn't all that great either. The amount of wear and tear you put on your car is ridiculous. The cost in maintenance and fixing doesn't do justice for your pay. The only good this job did me was the amount of auto collecting it let my gotcha evolve get in pokemon go.

Their driver took an hour to get to me and made 2 othet stops. My only thought was the food is going to be cold. Yep. Cheese was cold and stiff and fries were cold. Called customer service and they said there's nothing they can do since it arrived 15 mins early. More like an hour. They don't care if the driver has a few stop and the last person's food to be delivered will be cold. They said the food got here on time. That's all that mattered.

"Extremely disappointing customer service. I had placed an order for Buy 1 get 1 free - it didn't add that to the cart, and told me that I have to add 2 items to get that offer. I had done this in the past and the second 'free' item was automatically added to the cart. When I called customer service immediately, the person (Tony) could barely speak English and understand the issue. He kept me on hold for ~7 mins to come back and say the order cannot be canceled, since the merchant has already started preparing. When I asked him to call the merchant and add the second item, he informed me that cannot be done and that I have to call them. I called the merchant only to be told that Uber Eats has to do it online. This went on for several phone calls placed by me - and the end result was zero. When asked to connect to a supervisor, they informed me it was against their policy to connect to a supervisor.
Uber Eats has been consistently late, delivering cold food and with increasing service charges, the services are decreasing. I hope my review reaches the correct authorities, and they can look into the issue. Also, it would be really helpful, if they hire customer service operators who can speak and understand English.

"I don't use Uber because I have had issues previously with their Uber drivers, I know Uber don't care about anything but money.
My friend ordered Uber eats to my place on the weekend, and the driver delivered the food and then left, whether he actually left I am not sure about. 30 mins after the delivery was handed to me, the driver was back and buzzing my unit, I answered the intercom as i assuming he dropped something inside the complex and needed to come get it. He told me he needed to use the toilet and asked if I would let him use mine. I decided to do the right thing because Uber probably wouldn't care to ensure their drivers have bathroom access, they are reputable for being a poor employer and poor service, so I let him in to use my bathroom. When he came out of the bathroom, I expected he would than me and leave, but he wasn't leaving, he stayed near the door, looking around at my place. He seen my cat and started calling it over to which it ignored. Then he proceeded to ask me if I lived alone which made it clear he was not there because he needed to use the toilet. He couldn't see from where he was standing that I had a friend with me, but as soon as I told him another person was with me, he very quickly exited my unit without saying thanks or anything. This is extremely dodgy as he clearly didnt come to my home needing a bathroom, he either never left my complex and stayed for half an hour, or he left but then came back to target me because I am a young female and he thought i was alone. My friend contacted Uber via the app and told them what happened becuse we both felt very uncomfortable about what had happened, and Uber just sent a generic response to pretty much say sorry for the experience, and shut the conversation off. They are not looking into this incident and the driver can continue to try look for single women who live alone and try gain entry after deliveries. I already knew Uber would do nothing, it's typical Uber to not care.
I am wanting to warn everyone about using Uber that their drivers are untrustworthy and will try and target perople home alone and try gain access after the delivery is done. Do not trust Uber! They allow this to happen under their watch. Stay safe and avoid Uber, you cant trust your address with their drivers as you may be targeted. I have never had this issue with any other delivery app, it seems to be an issue with Ubers drivers, and probably because they let them get away with it and do nothing. I am now banning anybody from Using Uber at my home, apparently not using Uber myesf wasn't enough to avoid their problematic drivers.

"When Uber Eats first started you could order restaurant quality food. Now I feel like restaurants can give you anything and there is no recourse. The amount of crappy thrown together food I get is just disgusting. I ordered Outback surf and turf. The lobster (no butter) was like eating a piece of rubber. Like it was cooked in a microwave. The steak was a filet m-rare and I doubt it was a filet. I wondered why the 8oz was cheaper than the 6oz. The salad cucumbers were opaque, which is a clear sign of spoiling. The bread came with no butter and of course you have to top it off with no utensils. Despite clicking would like to add utensils (don't even know why that's even an option).
The only thing that was good was the cheesecake. I'm going to attribute that to the fact that it came out of box.

What is the recourse for that? I paid almost 2hrs of my hard earned work to get meal. Should delivery meals get the crap end of the deal? Uber nor the restaurant has any recourse for crap food. I get it it would be costly to except every complaint.
Consumers are getting poor quality food delivered because of this. Something needs to be put in place for people who use the service. At this point this is starting to be like a scam. I guarantee if anyone ever did an inquiry into this it would have many people upset. The consumer is being scammed.

Whether that be letting people check their food upon delivery or quality control checks at restaurants.

For now my only option is to stop using Uber. It's just starting to be more of a loss of like for a lot of restaurants and waste of money. I've slowed down tremendously in my usage of Uber. Today is definitely a day that will reduce even that.

This time I ordered and was given a wait time of 40-50 minutes again. After an hour of waiting my order was cancelled. I Have no idea who cancels orders or why. This is absolutely one of the poorest ways to let someone know
They wont get their order tonight. There is no one to call or discuss the issue with. So basically I have done nothing but try to use Uber Eats and as a customer I was $#*! on twice. I am a platinum AX card holder and I must say
I am extremely disappointed in the uber eats business program, especially when it comes to delivery times and the ability to follow up with a person should your order get cancelled. I would bet my AX payment next month which would
Total over 10k, should I give uber eats and Buffalo Wild Wings another shot, the order will get canceled or after 2 hours of waiting I will cancel it. There is no reason to wait for 2 hours for delivery. I literally live 2.0 miles from the store.

"I recently used Uber Eats for the first time and am extremely dissatisfied with the support and customer service I received. I had a promotional code for 15€ off my first order, but I had to cancel the initial order to add my VISA card as a payment method. After doing so, my promo code was no longer available, and despite explaining the situation in detail to Uber Eats support, I was denied a refund or a new promo code.

I understand that businesses must have policies and standards, but it is clear that my intention was to use the code on my first REAL order, not on one I had to cancel due to technical issues. The lack of flexibility and understanding in this case is disappointing and leaves much to be desired in terms of customer service.

After several exchanges with the support team, I was told they couldn't provide a different resolution despite acknowledging my situation. This leads me to believe that Uber Eats is the worst food delivery company I have trusted, as they have not only been unable to resolve a simple issue but have also lost another customer due to their rigidity and inflexibility.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Uber Eats to anyone after this experience and will be looking for other food delivery options in the future. It is a shame that such a large and well-known company has such poor customer service and an inability to adapt to specific situations. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of choosing a food delivery service that values and caters to the needs of their customers, and Uber Eats does not.

"I am a regular customer of Uber DoorDash and Skip the dishes the worst experience was with Uber and the worst thing is their customer service people they have one sentence to tell you and they repeated it like robots not humans so you feel like you are talking to a ""wall"" they are not even able to give an explanation you ask for a supervisor they tell you oh he is busy and he will call you later but you receive no call at all. I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I've been a frequent user of Uber Eats primarily because they deliver from restaurants that other, more reputable food service delivery companies don't tend to deliver from. In my opinion, this is the only plus that Uber Eats has going for them. I can't count on both hands the number of times my deliveries don't make it to the correct address. This is always a big inconvenience, even when the cost of the meal and driver tips are waived. I had this issue again this evening. Only this time I was told by the customer service representative that my order was delivered to the correct address and I wasn't eligible for a credit. Six different customer service representatives and myself attempted to contact the driver. The driver didn't pick up a single phone call. Meanwhile; I had DoorDash deliver the order. By the time I finished up my six phone calls, I attempted to cancel the tip for the driver that didn't deliver my meal. I was told by 3 additional representatives that I couldn't have a credit to make original form of payment. This is an issue as I'll never use this service again. In my opinion, the beyond poor customer service that Uber Eats stands by will put them out of business in the future.
Tip for consumers:
I recommend against using this delivery service.

"As a first time Uber eats customer, I order food from a restaurant & got matched with a low rated delivery driver! I was already skeptical about that… Fast forward to him supposedly bringing me my order he called me saying my address was wrong WHICH CLEARLY IT WASNT! He told me again that it wasn't my address and told me he was at a nearby store close by my house. So he put my personal address in his map on his personal phone and still claimed it was wrong and I then told him exactly how to get here from the store he was at near by my home which was only 3 mins away. He did the exact opposite of what I had told him & passed right by where I lived and turned his phone off when I tried to contact him to let him know he was going the wrong way. I called 3-4 times before I realized he's running off with my food purposely. I tried to tell a customer service rep and he said he can't do nothing about it cause he was still in his estimate time window. The driver put in his app that he delivered my food AND DIDNT and somehow the chat ""Disconnected"" and so I reported my order stolen basically well ""Never delivered"" They don't care about helping their customers at all. I reached out again and all they said was you have requested a refund…. I asked to speak to someone in a higher position and he said I couldn't then he said we will make sure he isn't ever connected with you again. First of all why are y'all letting this person continue to drive for you guys when he has low ratings? Anywho the customer service rep ignored me and disconnected the chat… Be cautious everyone

"Uber left me and my disabled mom stranded in another state and city. They have no number for riders to call for assistance. No you can't speak to someone else, No you can't speak to a supervisor, and no there is no other option to contact them other than email. Unacceptable. Uber responded to my email (of being stranded) 5 hours later. They dropped us off at a restaurant and then abandoned us. I couldn't call for a ride home because my phone number was wrong and associated with an old account. And you're not able to request a ride without a valid phone number. I'm switching to lyft to see how there customer service is.
Tip for consumers:
Uber Eats has a customer service line to call but they just refund part of the cost. You don't get all your money back for messed up orders. They don't address all the additonal fees, takes and tips associated with getting food delivered. If everything workout uber eats is good, but if you have problems its a scam.

"I have ordered food often through Uber Eats and have had several issues receiving my food order. They have very poor customer service. The support agents will not go the extra mile to help a customer out. They give you a bunch of lies. If you ask them for a managers name and contact info, they refuse to give you the info. All they say they can do is give you a refund. They claim they try and get in touch with the driver. They put you on hold for 3-5 minutes not knowing if they are really trying to contact the driver. All they say is that they couldn't reach the driver. If a customer asks for the managers contact information, they must provide it. If you want to gain respect from me, and receive a better review, I strongly suggest your support team learn to offer better customer service and go the extra mile. Pay the support agent needs to take customer service classes and learn the customers are the ones who pay the salary of your company.

"I am a regular customer of Uber DoorDash and Skip the dishes the worst experience was with Uber and the worst thing is their customer service people they have one sentence to tell you and they repeated it like robots not humans so you feel like you are talking to a ""wall"" they are not even able to give an explanation you ask for a supervisor they tell you oh he is busy and he will call you later but you receive no call at all. I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"As a first time Uber eats customer, I order food from a restaurant & got matched with a low rated delivery driver! I was already skeptical about that… Fast forward to him supposedly bringing me my order he called me saying my address was wrong WHICH CLEARLY IT WASNT! He told me again that it wasn't my address and told me he was at a nearby store close by my house. So he put my personal address in his map on his personal phone and still claimed it was wrong and I then told him exactly how to get here from the store he was at near by my home which was only 3 mins away. He did the exact opposite of what I had told him & passed right by where I lived and turned his phone off when I tried to contact him to let him know he was going the wrong way. I called 3-4 times before I realized he's running off with my food purposely. I tried to tell a customer service rep and he said he can't do nothing about it cause he was still in his estimate time window. The driver put in his app that he delivered my food AND DIDNT and somehow the chat ""Disconnected"" and so I reported my order stolen basically well ""Never delivered"" They don't care about helping their customers at all. I reached out again and all they said was you have requested a refund…. I asked to speak to someone in a higher position and he said I couldn't then he said we will make sure he isn't ever connected with you again. First of all why are y'all letting this person continue to drive for you guys when he has low ratings? Anywho the customer service rep ignored me and disconnected the chat… Be cautious everyone

"Horrible service. I am a business owner and used the uber eats site when i took over a business and informed them that the owner of the business had changed. They did not assist me when i attempted to change the bank details to recieve the payments and after many emails and calls they supposedly sent the money to me but when i sent them proof that this was not the case i was then told it was sent to the previous owner who assured me this was not the case and as i am no longer in contact i cannot get proof. Uber was aware that there was a change of owner and did not warn me or say anything about not using the previous owners account but now they have not sent the money they are telling me i shouldnt have continued using the previous owners account despite me being in contact with them about me using this account previously. Their support system is shocking and the drivers come much later than they are supposed to and the customer will not be updated that the driver is not at the shop and will instead be told that the restaurant is preparing the food which leads customers to leave negative feedback as they are unaware that it is ubers fault. The drivers regularly steal the food and Uber do nothing about it. Overall the service they provide is so bad and i do not reccommend using them as it will only negatively afftect your business.

So another driver picked up order and for some reason my order was delivered to the wrong address. Mind you it had been an hour and an half by now. I callled the Uber driver she told me where she was bc that's the address that was with my order which is bull$#*!. So I told the Uber driver I would just meet her where she was bc by that time it was going on two hours. On my way to the location the driver calls back saying they have my right address and w was headed to my house. Straight bull$#*!. So I called Uber eats customer service explained my situation and they were one rude as hell and refused to give me a refund or any apology they stated that my food was delivered in a timely manner and couldn't refund me my money. I also told them two hours after waiting for my food it was cold as $#*! and still no apologies no money back no nothing. $#*! UBER EATS THEY SUCK AND I WILL BE REPORTING THEM TO THE BBB.

"Uber Eats won't honor a cancelation 15 seconds after placing an order. Was basically told to pound sand.
Tip for consumers:
Avoid using this company altogether. They refuse to stand by their customers if you decide to cancel an order. I cancelled my order because a gift card was not being redeemed at the time of purchase, so I cancelled my order 20 seconds after my order was placed. If I had cancelled this order 3, 5, 10 minutes later I can understand. l I'm not alone and there are many poorly rated review on the web regarding Uber Eats. I ended up cancelling my account, and submitting a claim with my bank.

"Didnt receive my order, photo of drop off only shows a pic from his car window, support hung up on me because i got a restriction on my account for requesting too many refunds (2 refunds in the last 20 orders and both had picture proof for my issues), and i suggested that they should change the system so that support knows when that restriction is lifted (they say that the 'system' places the restriction temporarily and they do not know when though), she got a defensive tone but i didnt know what she said because she had a thick indian accent and its over the phone, so i asked her to repeat herself, then she just hangs up. Lol... waited 5 days for the call that i was told i would receive within a day just for that. How am i supposed to know when to request the refund again if i dont know when the restriction is up. I'll include a wonderful drop off photo that i was told ""the driver reached the drop off location"" ""once the order is dropped off its your responsibility"" ""the order was confirmed delivered"" ""your driver attached a drop off photo"" keep in mind, this isnt even my house, let alone the fact its not a picture of an order, rather its a blurry picture from a car window

Apparently uber eats supports restraunts that have roaches. And don't worry I am not stopping here. I will be calling the city to inform them they need to inspect that plave

"Can I give minus 10?
I ordered fish and chips from the Duck of Kent. Normally the Duck of Kent has very good fish and chips. What most restaurants seem to not understand is uber eats does a huge disservice to their quality of food. My food was picked up at 5:20 p.m. and I wached the driver, drive by my street three times and then go way out and then come back. It took him 35 mins to deliver my food and by then it was cold, the fries were mush. Why do restaurants continue to use these apps if they are such a disgrace to the quality of the food that restaurants provide? My advice. Not worth it to use uber eats, or any delivery service. Go back to your own delivery service and your customers will be happier. Ubers eats just is a rip off and is a poor reflection of the quality of food the restaurant provides.

Me thinking we cancelled the order so they will not charge my card was incorrect. So with me not receiving food or having a dasher come out they still charged my card 44 dollars. I reached out asking for a refund or even a credit and they advised they could not do that and are going to keep my money of 44 dollars even though i didn't receive any type of service.

Also after rating the driver, the system asks again for tip - you would think this tip will replay any tip already entered in the initial order steps, nooooo the tip was an add on to the already provided. So I ended up tipping more to this horrible delivery experience. I am deleting this app and never using again. UBER is gross, horrible, awful.

"If I could rate a zero I would. I just had the worst experience using Uber eats. I was already on the fence about using food delivery services, but decided to give it a try. I placed an order of food and instantly realized that my order was wrong. I tried to cancel the order immediately but couldn't find where to do it. It took me about 15 mins to figure out how to cancel my order. I had the ride share app only not Uber eats app. I even tried to call the restaurant but no success. I discovered I had to cancel the order in Uber eats app not the ride share app. When I finally cancelled the order and did not get the food I thought the order was cancelled successfully. I discovered the money still was charged to my account the next morning. I chatted with an Uber employee and was advised when I cancel an order after a merchant has accepted the order I still have to pay the merchant. I asked where was the food the employee ended the chat. So, I talked to 2 other employees before I understood what happen. I will never use this option again. They where not willing to give my money back. They called it fees and told me I should have reached out to them before I cancelled the order. Wow! Lost 46.00 and no food. High way robbery.

"I used to order pizza from Pizza Pizza directly. Pizza Pizza has Service guarantee to replace pizza if it is cold. Recently UberEats offered me free trial of UberOne which gives me good discounts and therefore I ordered from Pizza Pizza through UberEats for the first time. However, the ordered pizza arrived cold. I asked for replacement from UberEats and they denied. Therefore the lesson is: Never order pizza through UberEats or else you will forego the service guarantee as promised by the merchant. UberEats should honor the same service guarantee as offered by the respective merchant.

Yes I submitted my order seeing the basic order fee and tip but NOT other fees associated until after it's placed. I tried to cancel immediately after but there is no option. I call and told they can't refund my money. I said fine, then deliver the food since 80% of the charge is the fee for canceling. NOPE, ""Mary"" said she can't because they can't assign a delivery person at this time. A supervisor would not get on the line and I was told AFI would call me back because there was no way to transfer my call, really? No call back.

"Received notification that order had been delivered. It was not. Which was weird because she marked the order delivered two minutes after picking it up. It would have taken her 7 to 10 minutes to reach my home. I went through the process to contact the driver through the app and there was no answer, TWICE. While I was on a call with support, I went through the app, eventually figuring out how to get a refund. That was a nightmare. However, while talking to support, they told me that the driver successfully delivered to the correct address and said I am accountable after that. She said the driver indicated the specifics on what building to drop off. OK... so she read my drop off instructions and told support just that. I told them I did not get the picture of the location the order was left and that I would not be held responsible since there was absolutely nothing delivered and my Ring cam would have sent the notification she was there. Seriously Ubereats, if you want satisfied customers, don't tell them there is nothing you can do after the driver says they delivered to the correct address and did everything correct... did not provide a picture of the drop off. She totally stole this order! Are these the people you want your customers dealing with? I periodically do deliveries for Uber and always ensure the customers get what they pay for.

In Miami my Uber eats was fire no problems hardly any complaining food was always fresh even fast foods. Once I moved to Ft Walton Beach FL. Uber Eats Sucks here. 1) They always forget an item on the order. 2) they always forget to bring STRAWS in the bags especially fast food joints, they forget to put STRAWS like who order a drink and doesn't get a straw? Help me out here. 3) they've been cancelling my order right when it's about to be delivered. They make me wait like 2 hrs for the food and then leaving a message saying they cancelled, it's so late I can't order again. 4) was the last straw because these people brought my steak with out my Brussels sprouts or my carrots.

"I placed an order through McDonald's delivery app which was issued through Uber eats. The service I received was absolutely disgusting. The customer service advisors were unhelpful. I contacted them in regards to my order not arriving, even though the tracker stated my order was delivered. According to the advisor the rider stated on the system that he tried to contact me. Which was NOT the case as I have not received any notifications or a door knock. I spoke to the manager named Esha to explain my situation and she was extremely rude and dismissive, hanging the phone on me when I asked her a question. I still have not received a refund or my order which is unacceptable. Not only has it caused an inconvenience it has really upset me due to the way I have been treated. The advisors have taken the riders word and completely ignored my situation due to the ""guidelines"". I am now still sitting here with no food to eat and my money being held hostage.

The UberEats Rep advised that they could not do anything to assist. I did not ask for a refund, which they have needlessly done in the past when I advised them that only a portion of the order had an issue. Then they said they could not refund for the missing item because I had a number of refunds. I have never been dishonest in any reports of problems that I have had and have always submitted pictures. For them to do this and not even attempt to make this right is absurd. I asked to speak to a manager and the rep said one will have to call me back. I won't hold my breath waiting for that call.

"I drove for Uber Eats on the 17th of August 2022. I completed 4 trips and gas is $4 a gallon. When accepting the trip it states what you will be getting paid including tip. After completing the trips, it states that after 1 hour the funds would go to your virtual wallet. 24hrs later I have not received my tips for the trips I completed. When calling Uber Eats customer service, I was transferred 5 times on 17 August, and 6 times 18 August. I have spoken to 11 different people. It's impossible to drive and not be compensated for wear, fuel, and time, while Uber collects their 25% and the driver nothing. This is shameful and beneath fair business practices.

"I received an order coupon for $40, I later ordered that day. Trying to place my order I am only to find out over an hour later that it I am ineligible for this promotion. The Uber Eats Rep tells me through the chat that it's a glitch in the system and to place the order and they will credit the charge back. I should have figured out that this was going to be a problem when they disconnected and I could no longet get ahold of anyone on their support CHAT. I call up their customer service phone number trying to explain only to be rudely interrupted by the Customer service agent with a terrible phone manner and ultimately hung up on.

I call back and the next person hangs up on me after asking to speak to management.

The same thing happens a third time. I did actually get through to someone who was competent and listened to the feedback, but after three hangups and incorrect information from their reps.

This could be easily remedied with an automated script, but they don't even do that. Shameful customer service.

Three days later they send me a $15 dollar refund. In the middle of the night so I would not respond.
Calling back in the moring, speaking to Felicia, she indicated it was a %40 off coupon. Which it wasn't. After more time waisted Felicia did correct this problem.

I WILL NEVER USE UBER EATS, I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I SEND MY HOURLY BILL FOR WAISTING MY TIME.

"I just got an email from uber support team saying i have more frequent complaint over other customers. Please judge if Starbucks charge $5.24 plus tax for a small americano and forgot to add cream which I requested? I feedback and complained, was I wrong? The other day I ordered one order of choco croissants (with 2 generous portion as per starbucks menu description) but I received only one piece. I complained and the reply was only one piece. Later the tech support encourged me to contact restaurant for more accurate information. Then why do we need to so much extry for UberEat, they can close their busness? I just received an email from Ubereat saying I complain more often than other customers and they may discontinue my service. Who's fault is this? When we had no more pandemnic threat, I wish ubereat and all delivery app will fade out and their business won't survive because this service is not human and terrible customer service. Remember, I had no problem in payment more expensive meals from ubereat but I want above standard service and support. That email is very discriminating and I need to share with others here so we know how to deal with ubereat.

"When the driver arrived he messaged us ""I've arrived"" and came to the door, but it was the wrong order and he was standing there with a bottle of wine. We spoke to him AT THE DOOR! There was no delays or waiting period for the driver what so ever! The driver then went to his car, took a photo of the STEERING WHEEL (wrong practice and I know since I have done some deliveries for you before!) and wrongly completed the order! Since then we have been FIGHTING with Uber Eats to get our money back and they are ignoring our tickets, they say the driver waited for us for 5 minutes, which is simply untrue and HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE OUR ORDER! IT WAS WRONG - THE DRIVER STUFFED UP ROYALLY - THIS IS NOT OKAY! You have lost two GOOD customers! I am even subscribed to UberOne, but not anymore. You don't treat repeat customers like this!

I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"Completely wrong order more than $60 dollars and to be treated as I was trying to get a refund to get free money after having 35 orders on my account and from those 35 times I have ordered with Uber 4 of those I have made a complaint and 1 of those was a time where my food was stolen directly from the driver making the deliver so what I get is a customer cannot make a complaint more than 3 times in there account or complaints on a order where the order is more than $60 dollars and up because the account is flagged out. What kind of service is this? What kind of system
Is this? Uber eats saids they prioritizes there customers that's a complete lie and today was the day I experienced that after hearing all of my friends and family saying the same thing over and over again about there customer service now I didn't want to believe or expected that my account one day was going to to be flagged out and block to receive a refund in the future even though showing proof of wrong deliver or order received. It is unbelievable for me but Oh well guess I will be moving forward with making another competidor deliver app my new priority when choosing a delivery service Uber eats u lost a very loyal customer and I will be running to tell everyone I know how you guys and your system operates. Greedy system all for $$$$$ give me, give, give me system and $#*! off to the customer when it comes with dealing with a real problem…

"I agree with many people here; it is absolutely the worst customer service ever! I will say that they used to be good, responsive and extremely helpful. As of late, something has changed, and I'm so glad that I do not pay for Uber One. On February 5, I created a group order, and an item was left off of one of my coworker's orders. I submitted a ticket, and the usual, I was told that someone was looking into it. A week later, I checked on the status and received the same response. Two weeks later, I check the status, and the ticket was archived stating that a resolution had been reached. I resubmitted the ticket, and I was told they were aware of the issue and working to fix it. I asked what was the holdup, that it had been over two weeks. I stated this was very unprofessional and unfair to the person who did not receive the order she paid for. I was told they escalated the issue and are working hard to find a solution. I guess if this is an escalated issue, everyone in that department must be dead, because there has not been a resolution, and they previously tried to close the case without resolving the issue. True, it is only $4 and some change, but it is the principle of the matter that gives me pause... Uber, you really need to work on this, as your ratings on several sites are reflective of the level of service you have provided.

They said that charges were returned... so no proof of purchase.

"I have never had a more insane experience with food delivery as with Uber Eats in Pleasanton California. I would not recommend anyone order through the app in this town - use Door Dash or anything else! Not long ago I purchased over $80 from a very reputable restaurant only to never receive my order, when I finally got ahold of someone on the help line she told me the order had been delivered already and the driver left a note that they couldn't get through my apartment gate so they left it on the road outside. She told me she was sorry for my ""frustration"" but couldn't do anything because the order said it was ""delivered"". I fought with Uber Eats for two days afterward and was finally refunded - only to find out that they had tipped the driver some $24 dollars from my account that I did not authorize, and failed to refund me! The driver didn't make one attempt to contact me when all that happened, just dumped the food on the side of the road, and somehow got a $24 tip? More recently I ordered a simple burrito bowl from Chipotle through Uber Eats and asked for steak with lettuce, and salsa, no rice. I got about 5 sprigs of lettuce, a giant scoop of guacamole and sour cream and no steak... I figured I'd just be done with Uber Eats, it was only a $12 bowl and the delivery fee was only 49 cents...then I got an email showing that I was charged $25.60. I immediately took a picture and chatted with Cate who told me she would escalate this to management and I need not do anything more, they will contact me via email. Well 48 hours later they sent me two identical emails telling me they are sorry for my ""frustration"" but cannot refund me -- all I asked for was an adjustment given the fact that I didn't even get what I ordered! I wrote them a second time and received the exact same message. ""Frustration"" doesn't even cut it. They are, Needless to say, I'll never use Uber Eats in this area again and will steer everyone i know away from using that service here. The quality control is non-existent and the time it takes to get your money back is completely unacceptable. Do yourself a favor and, at least in Pleasanton/Dublin California, delete the Uber Eats App and don't look back.

"I private messaged Uber on FB, to speak to a manager. I was asked why, I answered politely, and was ignored even though I was promised a call last week. They also ignore me on twitter. Uber has the worst customer service, a rep refused to give me a refund for an order I never received, because I didn't phrase my sentence exactly how she wanted me to, then she ended the chat. The system reassigned me to her because when it asked if I was helped I said no. So she changed her name from Asna to a dot (.) and proceeded to ignore me, and eventually ended the chat. So, I called and the rep kept pretending he couldn't hear me, and hung up. He called back, stayed silent and hung up. My last driver refused to drop off my order at the door, and just left. The driver before that dropped of the wrong order, it was a huge order, it took me hours to get a rep on the phone for a refund. The driver apparently never answered their call, so they couldn't figure what happened to my huge order. I've been asking them for a call back to help me with the Uber ride app, but they just ignore my messages.

I was even patient and respectful the whole time speaking with the agents, but still they repeat themselves like broken records, pretend they do not know what I'm taking about and keep saying sorry this is not the experience we want you to have, but still no refund and they keep saying I should ""use my benefits"" no!

I was given the run around; first they don't process refunds after 48 hours. I don't want a refund, I never received an order, it was a cancellation. Second, I had too many attempts to get my money back on the order when it was my FIRST TIME EVER reaching out to them for help for anything UBER/UBER EATS related. Third, I had too many attempts on my account alone. That was just it for me at that point. I will NOT order from UBER EATS ever again. They give you crappy service while taking your money.

"No one ever use uber eats. What a terrible terrible service. Due to my knee injury I can't drive and it's hard for me to make dinner. So I decided to try uber eats for the first time. BIG MISTAKE! My sons burger was missing, so I try to reach support through the app to no avail, no one responding. So I call McDonald's and they say there's nothing they can do I have to get a refund through the app then reorder to get his burger to him. I google uber eats phone number since I can't get a hold of anyone on the app and have been told my account is restricted and I can't get a refund. I say why and the guy says I don't know. I say I'm injured how is my child going to get his burger? And he says he can't help with that or give me a refund. So I say I don't want a refund then I want the burger can someone just deliver the burger, he comes back saying the delivery driver won't deliver again for free and I would have to reorder the burger (that I already paid for) and pay all the fees again in order to get it delivered. Now I'm feeling extremely frustrated as my injury has caused me to be couch ridden and all I'm trying to do is feed my child so, I ask for a manager and he says one will call me back in 4-10 hours. What a joke. Of course I gave my son my burger, but I'm still hungry and can't move I'm going back to skip the dishes, at least they help when I call support.

I went back upstairs and contacted Uber by phone. I informed the customer service rep that I had not recieved my order. According to the rep, the driver is supposed to take a photo of where the order was left, I was told that there was no photo. The rep placed me on hold to contact rhe driver. The driver did not answer. The rep informed me that he left the driver a msg to contact me regarding the delivery. 2 hours later, NO call from the driver. I was told that I may recieve a refund 24-48 hours later, AFTER an investigation. I told them to delete my account.

"Unfortunately I have to give them one star. They are the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life with any app. They charged me $17.13 for canceling an order and then proceeded to charge me over $23 for the whole entire order! When I tried to get customer service help she told me that the order had already gone through and that because the merchant has started making it in under 3 minutes before I canceled my order I was still charged! There was absolutely no help whatsoever. This is the worst app ever! I tried to get in touch with them last night when I cancelled it and they charged me but no one helped me. I then tried to contact them again this morning to no avail. They are the worst company and I hope they go out of business. I really really really really hope they go out of business seeing as how they have very little stars from almost every customer that I have read about on the reviews. Poor $#*!ty customer service! There is no phone number to contact them and why would there be with so many customer complaints. No wonder nobody wants to pick up the phone or have a phone number for their customers to call them to dispute any transactions or charges that are outrageous! I hope people in the future before they download Uber eats will read the reviews beforehand so that they don't get charged outrageous canceling prices! They are absolutely ridiculous, absurd, the most obtuse people! I hate this app! I hate that company! And I'm disputing the charge with my bank. Like I said before I really hope they go out of business! That's the very least that they deserve. I hope they get sued and I hope all the bad things come to them! I'm not letting this go! I'm going to get back my money one way or the other! They care more about the merchant then they do the customers. It shouldn't cost over $23 to cancel an order. That is insane! All bad things to them! All bad things! $#*!S!
Tip for consumers:
Don't use it! Don't download it! You will be extremely disappointed with their customer service and the wait time for your order to be delivered if it's still delivered hot or cold depending on what you order. Mine usually comes to me for cold stuff melted and for hot stuff luke warm to damn near Cold! Absolutely worst worst app in the entire world. Absolutely worst customer service!

"This is now more then once that so have requested a refund and they refused to provide it to me. I made an order last evening and it was delivered and sealed tight it looked right but couldn't open it in front of the driver gave the code. Then when I opened it it wasn't my good, nothing that I ordered was inside, the restaurant had given me different items. No one ever called me to tell me, or ask my permission, no th y just did it, delivered it and we'll never gave my money back. Last thing week the items delivered from a different restaurant were also wrong and again they said it was nonrefundable. Well that isn't good enough, if you get the wrong items then they should be replaced or refunded. This is Ubers problem should not be mine.
Tip for consumers:
I went to customer service and the chat told me no you can't get your money back it is non refundable

"Ordered from old Chicago pizza was so exited to receive my Thai pizza. Found out uber eats was delivering they first got lost less than 1 mile from my apartment. Then when they finally got to my location it was over 15 minutes later the pizza was cold so cold I had to heat it up and it still wasn't enjoyable. When I complained they just ignored me and said they will look into it on that same day a charge for burger King showed up and was charged to me again when I told them about it they took so long to cancel it that they charged me anyway a cancelation fee. Also they put a hold on my card. Overall horrible experience.

"What a rip off this company is. I was ordering food and I accidentally hit the order button instead of the leave button. I corrected the mistake within 20 seconds and canceled the order. The restaurant I was ordering from was not even open yet. However I was charged through my account when I contacted Uber and the vendor I was told by the vendor I would have a refund within 48 hours so I waited no refund, I called Uber and they told me pretty much too bad too sad you waited too long to contact us so therefore we're not giving you your money back. What kind of business would do that? Why are we subjected to pay money that we don't owe from a company who I have used numerous times, this policy sucks and I will never ever ever order through them again. Instacart here we come. Between myself and my family we have probably ordered thousands of dollars worth of groceries or food over the last four years and they're willing to give up a good customer for $14.70

"Were you at the delivery address at the expected delivery time?:
Yes. I told them specifically where to meet me and they refused or couldn't find it.

Did the delivery partner try to contact you?:
Yes, but I told them I am on a computer and couldn't answer the phone. We were texting and they actively cancelled as I was responding.

Does your order appear as delivered or cancelled in the app?:
It says completed. I never received my order and I do expect a full refund.

Details:
I told them SPECIFICALLY where to meet me. They did not meet me there, took my food and cancelled my order.

Driver was Brandy, drives a Hyundai Elantra. Number is *******614. They did not answer any calls. They tried to contact me by calling and hanging up before I could answer. They are probably eating my damn food right now. Do Uber Eats drivers not see the location the buyer sets for them to drop the food off? Do they have an IQ of 0? Awful business. My whole family is deleting their Uber apps now.

"Ordered off lunch menu. I waited an hour. Uber eats picked up order, gets 5 mins from my house and then cancelled the order. Now the lunch menu is over for that restaurant. If I want to reorder the same exact food it will cost me $92, compared to my original order of $49. Sure it will be larger portions, but I don't need large portions for my lunch and go out of town tomorrow, so leftover's aren't an option either. Just really sucks. Uber headquarters from India called to tell me the order was canceled and I explained my side and he literally said ""you will have to contact customer service, bye bye"" (with an extremely rude annoying tone) and then hung up on me.

"I ordered scheduled delivery yesterday and the delivery person came with order from wrong restaurant. I said this is not from where I ordered. He said he will check with customer service and after sometime the order was cancelled saying the Delivery person could not contact me. When I reached out customer service, they said order is getting delayed and will have to wait for some more time. When contacted a little later, I was told order is cancelled and I will not even get refund for that.
When I explained what happened, they were hesitant to listen and when asked to contact higher level, she said I will be contacted shortly after I disconnect and haven't received a call until this point of time.

"I ordered foods from the same restaurants that I used for many years through Uber eats this evening. The delivery was late by 30 minutes than what the app said initially, then the Uber driver showed up at my door only to say he didn't have my food. He was on the phone with a rep for 15 minutes while I was standing by him waiting for my concern to be resolved. The driver reassured me that he will go back and bring my food in 10 minutes, then rep said that he can leave and deliver the other orders as my order will be delivered by someone else. The delivery guy reassured me my food will be delivered in 20 minutes, then left. Shortly after, I received a notification that my order has been canceled, and will be reimbursed (excluding the tip). I called the customer service and only thing they could do is to cancel the order and refund. I escalated to their supervisor only to be told that they can't compensate me for 2 hours that I've wasted because they didn't know how to do their job properly and because I am not subscribed customer.

"What's the purpose of putting delivery instructions in your profile if they are not going to respect them. I clearly have please meet me at the door and hand me the food. In addition to my food I ordered an orange Fanta as well. Well the app said the driver is 1 min away. Well it said that for 5 mins. I just happen to go to the door to look out to see if they were out there and I saw my food sitting on the ground with ants around the bag. And the orange Fanta was clear…go figure. So I picked everything up and came in the house. The beve to waste on my hand and it tasted like seltzer water. The only thing I could eat was the wings because they were in a covered box everything else was in the little open boat containers and I don't know if anything crawled in them. I tried calling the driver and it went to voicemail. So I contacted customer service through chat. They gave me a 4-5 paragraph apology and a $2 credit. Well the beverage it's self was $3.39. So I texted back and inquired what was the $2 for when the beverage was $3.39 their response was we've credited your account with $2 is anything else we can help you with. So needless to say I will go back to DOORDASH! I will not be using Uber Eats again. They can take those $2 and give them to someone else!

"I ordered something from Uber Eats that was expected to arrive at 7:20 PM. It ended up arriving past 8:50 PM. When I told customer service, their only response was that they could cancel it. This was when the food had already been packaged and was in the Uber driver's car. So that meant the only thing that would be done is the food would be returned to the restaurant and ultimately thrown out. They would not provide any credit or sincerely apologize for this. They said the latest delivery time would be 7:55 so this was a significant difference, and I ended up buying another dinner by 8:00 PM, since I was hungry and wanted something to eat. They were not a good service, and not helpful at all.

"I received a gift card, which I printed out. I was going to do a pick up but changed my mind and decided to order delivery. I did so but when I went to use the gift card, it said it was already redeemed. I already had a visa in listed in their system so went ahead and used that. I thought that maybe it was listed as redeemed because I had already printed; it so called the customer service number listed to see about getting a refund. After about a 45 minute wait, the person who answered wanted my e-mail which I had to verify to update my password earlier, but she couldn't find it in her system. Then she asked for an order number, which I hadn't written down and had no e-m and she chided me for not writing this down. Then she asked for my card number and I gave her the credit card number the order was under, when she couldn't find the information that way I tried a different card, thinking maybe I was mistaken. Finally she realized I wasn't giving her the gift code number and acted like the miscommunication was my fault and when I pointed out she had been asking me about my card she denied this, even though she had just done so. Then when I gave her the gift card number she informed that she had already told me that without the correct e-mail she couldn't use the card number... It went on like this for quite some time. I asked for another number to call to be able to get a higher level of help, explaining to her that, although she was doing the best she can, I was frustrated that my e-mail wasn't working with their system and that I hadn't received any type of confirmation follow-up except to confirm my order was in process of being delivered -- that I wanted to talk to someone more informed about these things. She claimed there was nowhere else to call except the number she was at. (Which in all fairness might be true). I did also say I planned to call the Better Business Bureau, but this was not something that seemed important to her. I did try to call again, with the order number I was given by the restaurant and then, the person I gave the order number to said it was the wrong order number and that I would have to call the purchaser to get the order number that was given at the time of the gift purchase... I do not have proof of purchase as the restaurant did not send a receipt nor did I receive any confirmation of purchase from Uber eats as noted earlier.

I contacted the uber eats customer service number and now that it had been over a month I had to take the L and pay the amount so I wouldn't get charged by the credit company.

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IF AN ORDER IS CANCELED THAT THE CUSTOMER IS NOT CHARGED FOR IT! $56.62 IS NOT A SMALL AMOUNT, I WORKED MINIMUM WAGE and tried to order for my whole family BUT NOOOOOOOOOO DIDN'T WORK OUT SO I CANCELED RIGHT AWAY AND STILL GOT $#*!IN CHARGED.

"I ordered groceries this morning from Uber Eats because I had 40% off promo code. Minimum order was 70$ so I made an order just over 71$.
While the driver was shopping, the promo suddenly disappeared from basket. I couldn't rise concern as I wasn't billed yet. After the purchase was done the promo never applied and it was also gone from my promotions as I had technically used it.
After I received the delivery I turned to help section. They admitted that there was issue with the backend. BUT as I couldn't provide the promo code screenshot they refused to refund me. So I paid full price and got treated like a moron for NOT providing a picture.
So I consider Uber Eats a scam. Why would I as customer screenshot my promo code each time in fear of being ripped off?! This is nonsense. Especially because customer service already admitted mistake on their end.
After disagreeing with the rip off decision I just entered endless loop of automatic response of no screenshot no help.
And I pay for Uber One. Which I deeply regret now.
So yeah, steer clear from discount codes as they are a joke and you as a paying customer are too a joke to them. Garbage company and garbage customer service.

"For a few months, I had a monthly membership that was $9.99/m. Out of no where, I was charged $60 for an annual membership(this was in July 2023). I never changed or canceled my monthly membership, nor authorized to be charged for the annual membership. I chocked it up to a glitch, contacted customer service, and they refunded me. I continued my monthly membership for 9.99 for a month, then decided to cancel it all together, because I wasn't using it enough to justify paying for it. Woke up today to a 14.99 charge from UberOne on my bank account. [Follow along, because this get confusing]. Contacted customer service, asked for a cancellation and refund. I was told because I had already been refunded in the past(that annual membership I never signed up for), that they wouldn't refund me. So I asked why it was 14.99 instead of the monthly 9.99, he told me it was for a 3-month membership and I was ""only charged 14.99 instead of the standard 30 for three months"" as if I should be appreciative. He then explained it as ""You canceled the annual membership, but kept your monthly membership, so you were charged for a 3 month membership."" EXPLAIN to me how that makes sense. I never should have been charged for the annual. I shouldn't have been charged for the 3 months, after canceling it all together. And I shouldn't have been charged for 3 months PERIOD because I never signed up for it. He and I went around in circles for 15 minutes then he hung up the chat.

"I have just gotten off the phone with your support staff. 3 times in one week, I was overcharged, not receiving the 2 for 1 discount advertised for Sunny Jims in Pittsburgh, PA. After finding this, I went back and found I have been overcharged TWELVE TIMES from Sunny Jims since August 2,2023, not once getting the 2 for 1 promotion price. If you look at my account you will see I use your service 7 days a week, sometimes twice in one day. Your rep tells me there will be no refund of the $120.00 stolen from me in little more than a month, as those transactions are more than 48 hours old. It appears that Uber may be doing this intentionally to steal from a loyal customer. Is this how you reward me for spending thousands of dollars with Uber?

I complained to Uber eats customer service and they said I wasn't eligible for a refund! How? I've only had 2 previous refunds! I'm guessing they're counting the fact that I had 2 other orders that were CANCELLED by UBER because the store was out of stock! So they can't hold that against me since they were the ones to cancel! Uber eats tried to offer me UBER CASH but I REFUSED because that's not how I paid for my order! I paid for my order with MY HARD EARNED MONEY! I didn't pay with Uber cash! SO I EXPECT MY REFUND BACK TO MY ORIGINAL FORM OF PAYMENT! Uber eats wants to give me Uber cash so I can spend the money with them again instead of refunding me by my original form of payment. THIS IS FRAUD AND THEFT! They want to wrongfully keep my money by any means possible! How is it I'm eligible for Uber cash but not to my original form of payment?

"So aside from the fact that the only way to talk to customer support is through ""texting"" they also are the worst customer support I've ever dealt with. I had 2 people literally end the chat on me when I was trying to explain my issue, then constantly got shut down by others. What happened was, my boyfriend and I ordered food from Red Robin, after ordering it I checked my phone about 5 to 10 minutes later and I noticed my order was canceled and I had a notification from Uber saying ""we're sorry your order didn't go through but it's probably an easy fix"". So naturally I went back and reordered the exact same things from the same place, when it showed up there was 2 orders my first order and the second one and 2 charges on my bank account...I was very upset because not only was that way more food than my boyfriend and I needed but also because it was over 100 dollars I was charged when I should have only been charged for 1 order. I don't feel like this should be my fault since Uber literally notified me telling me my order did not go through... after I explained this to a few of the support people they were rude to me and basically told me they won't do anything for me since I received both orders. I'm confused how it is my fault, when UBER told me the first order did not go through! I have ordered from Uber many times I been a loyal customer and I tip well and yet they treated me like crap and did nothing to help solve the issue. My advice to everyone is use Door dash or some other delivery service because if something goes wrong Uber will not help you. I'm never supporting Uber again.

Whenever I place an order, i remove the Tip and give the Deliver person a Cash tip. For this order, I gave the Delivery person $5.00 when they delivery my order.

Well, the next day I got an email from Uber Eats and they are charging me an additional tip for $5.07,

I called their customer service and spoke for about 45 minutes with a person named Zarah, and she told me that I will receive an email regarding my issue after we speak. She could not give me back a credit for the Charged Tip and I was told I will recieve an email the next day. Well, I didn't receive any emails so I called back today and was told the same thing by another customer representative named Maya. I got the ""Run-Around"".

I can't believe this company is dishonest and with no integrity and have no regards for their customers. I usually order about six times a month but I will not longer place an order with them.

I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I would not recommend Uber Eat. I live in Manchester and the service here is poor. It was very often I missed some items from my order. Anyway my money was refunded. But not last time. My order was delivered to the wrong address, I could see it on photo, provided by driver. He left the order outside the door. I have never selected the option to leave my order outside. I was always waiting. The driver tried to contact me, I sent him a message to remind my address.
The Uber Eat customer team decided that I was eligible for a refund. I sent them the picture, made by a driver. But they somehow refunded me a half an order. I sent them emails and every time different agent respond and every time differently. It is not possible to contact Uber team and you'll hardly find a complaint section. I only could get a webchat. My issue still not resolved.
I will never order again by Uber Eat.
If you have an option to order strait from restaurants or supermarkets do it, it is cheaper and less stressful. Anyway, if you decided to order from Uber Eats, I recommend: make screenshots of the cost (how it looks first time) and items on your order, the time your order takes, try to contact a driver by message and take screenshots. If a driver making a picture - you need to save it. All of that it you will need to provide as an evidence for customer team. Or your money will never be refunded. Hope my review is helpful

"THIS COMPANY TREATS ITS DRIVERS TERRIBLY, DONT WORK FOR THEM. Let me start by saying that ordering food from this company is a rip off, for the customer and the driver. The average pay per trip as a driver for uber eats is $2 no matter the distance, so any real money is made through tips. Their system will also miscalculate trip earnings and give you trips where the restaurants are closed or the restaurant can't make the food, be careful if you cancel trips too many times it's YOUR FAULT, whether you call to verify a closed restaurant or not. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. My account was wrongfully deactivated due to ""cancelation fraud"" it was Christmas eve and their system gave me many trips where the restaurants were closed early, I verified every order over the phone, the next day without warning my account was permanently deactivated. You try to call and you get uneducated, unprofessional, sensitive, morons from the Philippines that will not help you or give you any reasoning as to why your account is terminated, and then you will be hung up on for ""being rude"".

I then placed another order the next day which took nearly 1hr, they state if it goes passed the max estimates time you get £5 credit which I did not, my food was missing two items, took 1hr and had cold items. I asked 3 times for a refund and got the same automated response. I sent pictures and have proof for it all yet I got the same automated response. 3 times. They are a joke and just take your money. That's all they care about. If you need all the pictures I have them saved for both orders, But I will not hold my breath.

"Apparently uber eats drivers can steal other drivers orders and then cancel the order and you never get your food! Then you have to run through an AI robotic maze trying to explain this. Once you finally reach someone through the chat line its been another hour. The order is canceled and your told to have a great day

"My first experience using ubereats delivering an order from LA herradura will be my first and last. Our driver Isaac had at some point while waiting on our food so he said...sent us a text saying that he was at the restaurant... they were running behind...the food would be up shortly... they were just busy for the weekend. When we got the food we were missing over half of our order... the food was extremely cold and drenched from the juices...so soggy. We called the restaurant and I actually spoke to the person who said he specifically packaged our food and handed our driver two bags not one... And he then went on to say that our driver was late he was not on time. When we called customer support she looked up the status and it did show that he was late picking up the food, so why did he lie to us in the text? And his name was Isaac maybe you should have a discussion with him... She then went on to explain that they do not send another driver to pick up the difference of our food or replace the rest of it as well but I would only get a refund for what we were missing. Not only that she then went on to say that she was going to give a $40 credit on the Uber's cash along with the refund to my bank account.
So then I wake up this morning to go on to my account and the Uber cash has now been lowered to $23 wow who does that?
Great way of taking care of your guests and resolving issues... Never again... Our order was initially over $100 by the time the service fee the delivery fee and our generous tip it then came to $118...
When I asked how to lower the tip to go back and adjust it she told me to go to my orders on my Uber account nowhere on there does it show that you can adjust the tip once it has went through... Another lie I'm assuming.
Thanks for the worst first experience ever ordering food and having it delivered...

I order from subway they didn't have what I order but still took the order and now I don't have food or my money can't talk to a real person so I didn't get nothing. No customer service on both ends.,"January 23rd, 2024",1,T K.,sitejabber
"I am a regular customer of Uber DoorDash and Skip the dishes the worst experience was with Uber and the worst thing is their customer service people they have one sentence to tell you and they repeated it like robots not humans so you feel like you are talking to a ""wall"" they are not even able to give an explanation you ask for a supervisor they tell you oh he is busy and he will call you later but you receive no call at all. I made a order on Uber eats from Made in India and I realized that I didn't mention the allergy and I cancelled right immediately even before accepting the order from the store and I made a new order but when I asked for refund of that order they are like oh it is not eligible for refund I said fine but give me an explanation please they said the store already prepared the order haha which was so funny because I work in restaurant I know how everything goes so I said do they prepare a whole order in less than one minute? Do they started preparing the order even before confirming it? They said this all what we have to tell you so I asked for supervisor 3 times all they said he will call you but no one called me. I called the store to ask them and the manager there said oh no we didn't prepare that order at all because it was cancelled immediately so I called Uber again to tell them but the agent said this time that we can't do the refund because you already reached the refund amount that you are allowed to haha that sooooo funny because that means you use Uber you loose your money they took it even if your order is mistaken or something is missing in your order even you don't receive the order at all. So you pay your own money but Uber they put for you a limit for refund once you reach that limit you will loose your money if you get a wrong order or a missing item on the order or if you dare cancelling an order like this they work in Uber Be AWAR please from Uber app and Uber costumer service the other apps are way more professional and safe personally I delete my account NOW because I don't want to get SCAMMED again

"I'm not lying when I say...Uber eats has the worst drivers and customer service when there is a problem. I rarely have issues with door dash but with uber eats 9 out of 10 times there is an issue. Either delivery to the wrong address or a missing item or missing half the order. I realize you don't need a high education to deliver goods, but some common sense would help. For uber eats, a way to refund a customer if a restaraunt doesn't have an item or they forget to put it in. Uber eats had the audacity to send me an email stating I had too many requests for refunds and they would no longer refund me. How is an error made by the restaraunt or the driver, the customers fault? They told me to rate the restaraunt as the remedy for missing items. Ok...I can do that, but who is going to refund my money? Many times I had to go to the restaraunt or call them to tell them I didn't get items. They never issue a refund because they don't have the card there. Most times they tell you ""next time you come in we will give you the item"". Ha! Ridiculous! Defeats the purpose of getting food delivered if you have to solve the issue and go pick up item later...what if a disabled or elderly person couldn't go get it? The restaraunt keeps your money and uber basically tells you to piss off and blames YOU, the customer. This is the worst customer service to operate like that! Do yourself a favor... bypass the headache and join door dash!

"My address was incorrectly inputted, I immediately went to change it on the order. ""It's too late to change your address!"" the website tells me. Really? Too late? A minute after I put it in, a driver hasn't been assigned and it's too late? I'll just call customer support--

Thirty minutes later and my sixth CS person, they tell me they can't. Thirty minutes and six: ""we're sending you to a team better able to handle this issue!"" to tell me they can't? Then why does the website recommend calling customer support?

So what did they tell me: contact the driver. I would, but the number on the account is old -- and apparently you can't change that either! Amazing. Can't CS do it? Nope! Can't change my freaking number!

While this was happening, I sent the driver three messages. None of them were read, opened, responded to. The food was dropped off in some random parking lot and labelled as ""Complete!""

The driver has a little bit of the blame for not bothering to even look at the messages, I have a bit of the blame for not double checking the address, Uber has a huge amount of the blame for making the slightest of issues take forever to (not) resolve!

OH AND THEY CAN'T GIVE ME A REFUND BECAUSE MY ACCOUNT HAS REACHED THE ""LIMIT ON REFUNDS""! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I WAS GETTING A REFUND.
