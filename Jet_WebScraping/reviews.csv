Consistent bad quality food delivered. 6 months now all orders placed through uber eats has been like trash put together and delivered... I've deleted my account and will not continue to use this provider. They allow restaurants to send out bad quality and undercooked food to paying customers... shame on you uber!

"RIPPED OFF and NO Recourse! Absolute Goat-Rope. Yet another business hiding behind COVID-19 for poor customer service. I was overcharged for my order, but have yet to receive a refund. I ordered and paid for two pizzas, but only got one. On top of that, the delivery arrived 35 minutes after the time UberEATS' ‘estimated' time of delivery. To make matters worse, there is ZERO customer support. No call center, no chat... nothing. If/when my refund hits, that App is going in the garbage where it belongs.Tip for consumers:Although DoorDash’s isn’t a gold standard service, its customer service is markedly better than UberEATS. During the instances in which there’ve been discrepancies in charges, DoorDash has done a much better job of responding to them and issuing refunds in a far more timely manner. In addition, DoorDash’s estimated times of delivery are much more accurate than Uber’s. I get the impression UberEATS just doesn’t care. They get their payment and they’re done with you.

"This is not my first issue with Uber Eats, but it us my last. The order was all wrong missing strawberry shake, 6 pack of cinnamon rolls, straw, napkins.

The driver delivered food to our neighbor at 6:55 pm. We have witnesses saying that he drove a white van and knocked down our newly purchased professional basketball hoop then went on to deliver the food. We also have a video from our neighbor's house proving this recklessness. We have no note of apology nor was the basketball hoop put aside. It was blocking our driveway and nearly hit my car! Very irresponsible and dishonest driver. Our children are distraught and this is extremely upsetting. Please don't go with UberEats.Grubhub and Doordash are better as we use them all the time and have never encountered such a problem.,"April 10th, 2020",1,Kristine H.
